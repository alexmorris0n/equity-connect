            <p>I'm <span class="variable">{{accountSignature}}</span> with Equity Connect.</p>

            <p>Your home in <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> has approximately <span class="variable">{{estimated_equity}}</span> in equity.</p>

            <p>Here's what many high-equity homeowners don't know:</p>

            <p>You can access <span class="variable">{{equity_50_percent}}</span> to <span class="variable">{{equity_60_percent}}</span> without selling your home, making monthly payments, or moving anywhere.</p>

            <p>Plus:</p>

            <p>The money is NOT taxable as income<br>
            Your heirs still inherit any remaining equity<br>
            You keep the title</p>

            <p>This is called a reverse mortgage - backed by the FHA and used as a strategic planning tool by thousands of homeowners.</p>

            <p>We pre-qualify homeowners, then connect them with trusted specialists in their area. For <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span>, we work with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span> at <span class="variable">{{broker_company}}</span> (NMLS #<span class="variable">{{broker_nmls}}</span>).</p>

            <p>Many clients include their financial advisor in our initial conversation - we're happy to do that if it makes sense for you.</p>

            <p>Want to see if you qualify? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 10 minutes).</p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">{{firstName}}</span>,</p>

            <p>Homeowners with substantial equity like yours often use this for three strategic reasons:</p>

            <p><strong>Tax-free income</strong><br>
            The money you receive is NOT taxable as income - unlike selling stocks or withdrawing from retirement accounts. This can be significant for your tax situation.</p>

            <p><strong>Estate planning</strong><br>
            Keep your liquid savings for your children. Use your home equity for your lifestyle instead. Your heirs still inherit any remaining equity after the loan is repaid.</p>

            <p><strong>Retirement flexibility</strong><br>
            Turn your home equity into monthly income if you choose. Gives you more options for how you spend your retirement.</p>

            <p><strong>Your situation:</strong></p>

            <p>Available to you: <span class="variable">{{equity_50_percent}}</span> to <span class="variable">{{equity_60_percent}}</span><br>
            Tax treatment: NOT counted as taxable income<br>
            Monthly payments: None while you live there</p>

            <p>Many clients discuss this with their financial advisor before proceeding. We're happy to include them in the conversation.</p>

            <p>Want to explore these options? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 10 minutes).</p>

            <p>Many of my clients with high-value homes include their financial advisor or accountant in our initial conversation.</p>

            <p>This makes sense for a property like yours with approximately <span class="variable">{{estimated_equity}}</span> in equity.</p>

            <p><strong>What we'll cover:</strong></p>

            <p>Exact amount available based on your age<br>
            Tax implications for your situation<br>
            How this fits with your retirement plan<br>
            Comparison: Reverse mortgage vs home equity loan vs HELOC<br>
            Impact on inheritance and estate planning</p>

            <p>We can meet with you and your advisor together, or speak with your advisor separately if you prefer.</p>

            <p>If you don't work with a financial advisor, that's perfectly fine - we'll walk you through everything directly.</p>

            <p>We pre-qualify you first, then connect you with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span> at <span class="variable">{{broker_company}}</span> to discuss your specific situation.</p>
