**Opportunity Introduction**

**Subject:** Your {{property_city}} home - {{equity_formatted_short}} available

Hi {{firstName}},

I'm {{accountSignature}} with Equity Connect.

You've built substantial equity in your {{property_city}} home - approximately {{estimated_equity}}.

Here's something most homeowners with high equity don't know:

You can access between {{equity_50_percent}} and {{equity_60_percent}} from your home's equity without selling, moving, or making monthly payments.

People use this money for:

• Extra retirement income  
• Medical expenses  
• Home improvements  
• Helping family

This is called a reverse mortgage. It's federally insured and used by over 60,000 homeowners last year.

We pre-qualify homeowners, then connect them with trusted specialists in their area. For {{property_city}}, we work with {{broker_name}} (NMLS #{{broker_nmls}}).

Want to see if you qualify? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 5-10 minutes).

**Four Use Cases**

**Subject:** Four ways to use your {{estimated_equity}} equity

Hi {{firstName}},

Since you have substantial equity in your {{property_city}} home, let me show you how homeowners typically use this:

**1. Monthly income stream**  
Get regular deposits for retirement. Nothing to pay back while you live there.

**2. Healthcare costs**  
Cover medical expenses without selling your home or draining savings.

**3. Home modifications**  
Install walk-in shower, wheelchair ramp, stair lift. Age in place safely.

**4. Help family**  
Help kids with down payment or give grandkids college money.

**Your numbers:**

Equity: approximately {{estimated_equity}}  
Available to you: {{equity_50_percent}} to {{equity_60_percent}}  
Monthly payment: $0

This is federally insured. The money is NOT taxable as income.

We pre-qualify you first, then connect you with {{broker_name}} to discuss your specific situation.

Ready to see if you qualify? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today (takes 5-10 minutes).

## EMAIL 3 - DAY 7
**Social Proof + Urgency**

**Subject:** Two real examples from {{property_city}}

Hi {{firstName}},

Last month, I connected two homeowners in {{property_city}} with {{broker_name}}.

Both had substantial equity - similar to your approximately {{estimated_equity}}.

**Homeowner, age 72** - Home worth approximately {{property_value}}

Accessed 60% of their equity. Zero monthly payments. Using the money for retirement income - about $2,400 per month.

**Homeowner, age 68** - Home worth approximately {{property_value}}

Accessed 55% of their equity. No payments required. Made home improvements to age in place safely - new bathroom, wider doorways, ramp.

Both kept their homes. Both have zero payments now.

This is my third message about your home equity.

If you're interested, reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes 5-10 minutes).

Otherwise, I'll close your file.
