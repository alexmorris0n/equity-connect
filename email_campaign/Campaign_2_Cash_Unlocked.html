            <p>You've built substantial equity in your <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> home - approximately <span class="variable">{{estimated_equity}}</span>.</p>

            <p>Here's something most homeowners with high equity don't know:</p>

            <p>You can access between <span class="variable">{{equity_50_percent}}</span> and <span class="variable">{{equity_60_percent}}</span> from your home's equity without selling, moving, or making monthly payments.</p>

            <p>People use this money for:</p>

            <p>- Extra retirement income<br>
            - Medical expenses<br>
            - Home improvements<br>
            - Helping family</p>

            <p>This is called a reverse mortgage. It's federally insured and used by over 60,000 homeowners last year.</p>

            <p>We pre-qualify homeowners, then connect them with trusted specialists in their area. For <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span>, we work with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span> at <span class="variable">{{broker_company}}</span> (NMLS #<span class="variable">{{broker_nmls}}</span>).</p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">{{firstName}}</span>,</p>

            <p>Since you have substantial equity in your <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> home, let me show you how homeowners typically use this:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Monthly income stream</strong><br>
            Get regular deposits for retirement. Nothing to pay back while you live there.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Healthcare costs</strong><br>
            Cover medical expenses without selling your home or draining savings.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Home modifications</strong><br>
            Install walk-in shower, wheelchair ramp, stair lift. Age in place safely.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Help family</strong><br>
            Help kids with down payment or give grandkids college money.</p>

            <p><strong>Your numbers:</strong></p>

            <p>Equity: approximately <span class="variable">{{estimated_equity}}</span><br>
            Available to you: <span class="variable">{{equity_50_percent}}</span> to <span class="variable">{{equity_60_percent}}</span><br>
            Monthly payment: $0</p>

            <p>This is federally insured. The money is NOT taxable as income.</p>

            <p>We pre-qualify you first, then connect you with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span> at <span class="variable">{{broker_company}}</span> to discuss your specific situation.</p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">{{firstName}}</span>,</p>

            <p>Last month, I connected two homeowners in <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span>.</p>

            <p>Both had substantial equity - similar to your approximately <span class="variable">{{estimated_equity}}</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>Homeowner, age 72</strong> - Home worth approximately <span class="variable">{{property_value}}</span></p>

            <p>Accessed 60% of their equity. Zero monthly payments. Using the money for retirement income - about $2,400 per month.</p>

            <p><strong>Homeowner, age 68</strong> - Home worth approximately <span class="variable">{{property_value}}</span></p>

            <p>Accessed 55% of their equity. No payments required. Made home improvements to age in place safely - new bathroom, wider doorways, ramp.</p>

            <p>Both kept their homes. Both have zero payments now.</p>

            <p>This is my third message about your home equity.</p>
