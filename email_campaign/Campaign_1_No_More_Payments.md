**Subject:** {{property_city}} - eliminate your monthly mortgage payment

Hi {{firstName}},

I'm {{accountSignature}} with Equity Connect.

I work with homeowners over 62 who are still making mortgage payments.

Most people don't realize you can eliminate your monthly payment completely - and keep your home.

Your home in {{property_city}} is worth approximately {{property_value}}. Based on your equity, you could receive between {{equity_50_percent}} and {{equity_60_percent}}.

Then never make another mortgage payment.

You keep your home. No sale required. You stay right where you are.

This is called a reverse mortgage - a government-insured program that over 60,000 homeowners used last year.

We pre-qualify homeowners, then connect them with trusted specialists in their area. For {{property_city}}, we work with {{broker_name}} (NMLS #{{broker_nmls}}).

Want to see if you qualify? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 5-10 minutes).

## EMAIL 2 - DAY 3
**Objection Handling**

**Subject:** Quick question about your {{property_city}} home

Hi {{firstName}},

Most people ask me: "What's the catch?"

There isn't one. Here's how it works:

• You keep your home - no sale required  
• You keep the title - your name stays on it  
• Zero monthly payments - government-insured program  
• Your heirs inherit any remaining equity

The only requirement: you must be 62 or older.

Here's what that looks like for your situation:

Current home equity: approximately {{estimated_equity}}  
Cash you could receive: {{equity_50_percent}} to {{equity_60_percent}}  
Your new monthly payment: $0

Most homeowners with your equity level pre-qualify easily.

We pre-qualify you first, then connect you with {{broker_name}} to discuss your specific situation.

Want to verify your eligibility? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today (takes 5-10 minutes).

## EMAIL 3 - DAY 7
**Social Proof + Urgency**

**Subject:** Two {{property_city}} homeowners just did this

Hi {{firstName}},

Last month, I connected two homeowners in {{property_city}} with {{broker_name}}.

Both had homes worth around {{property_value}} with good equity - similar to your situation.

They both used a reverse mortgage to eliminate their monthly payments.

**What happened:**

A 68-year-old homeowner accessed 60% of her equity. No more payments. She's using the money for retirement income.

A 72-year-old homeowner accessed 55% of his equity. Zero monthly payments. He made home improvements so he can stay in his home longer.

They both kept their homes. They both have zero payments now.

This is my third message about your {{property_city}} home.

If you're interested, reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes 5-10 minutes).

Otherwise, I'll close your file.
