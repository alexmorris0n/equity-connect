**Strategic Introduction**

**Subject:** Your {{property_city}} home - {{equity_formatted_short}} in equity

Hi {{firstName}},

I'm {{accountSignature}} with Equity Connect.

Your home in {{property_city}} has approximately {{estimated_equity}} in equity.

Here's what many high-equity homeowners don't know:

You can access {{equity_50_percent}} to {{equity_60_percent}} without selling your home, making monthly payments, or moving anywhere.

Plus:

• The money is NOT taxable as income  
• Your heirs still inherit any remaining equity  
• You keep the title

This is called a reverse mortgage - backed by the FHA and used as a strategic planning tool by thousands of homeowners.

We pre-qualify homeowners, then connect them with trusted specialists in their area. For {{property_city}}, we work with {{broker_name}} (NMLS #{{broker_nmls}}).

Many clients include their financial advisor in our initial conversation - we're happy to do that if it makes sense for you.

Want to see if you qualify? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 10 minutes).

**Tax & Estate Benefits**

**Subject:** Smart options for high-equity homeowners

Hi {{firstName}},

Homeowners with substantial equity like yours often use this for three strategic reasons:

**Tax-free income**  
The money you receive is NOT taxable as income - unlike selling stocks or withdrawing from retirement accounts. This can be significant for your tax situation.

**Estate planning**  
Keep your liquid savings for your children. Use your home equity for your lifestyle instead. Your heirs still inherit any remaining equity after the loan is repaid.

**Retirement flexibility**  
Turn your home equity into monthly income if you choose. Gives you more options for how you spend your retirement.

**Your situation:**

Available to you: {{equity_50_percent}} to {{equity_60_percent}}  
Tax treatment: NOT counted as taxable income  
Monthly payments: None while you live there

Many clients discuss this with their financial advisor before proceeding. We're happy to include them in the conversation.

Want to explore these options? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 10 minutes).

## EMAIL 3 - DAY 7
**Advisor-Inclusive Approach**

**Subject:** Include your financial advisor in this conversation

Hi {{firstName}},

Many of my clients with high-value homes include their financial advisor or accountant in our initial conversation.

This makes sense for a property like yours with approximately {{estimated_equity}} in equity.

**What we'll cover:**

• Exact amount available based on your age  
• Tax implications for your situation  
• How this fits with your retirement plan  
• Comparison: Reverse mortgage vs home equity loan vs HELOC  
• Impact on inheritance and estate planning

We can meet with you and your advisor together, or speak with your advisor separately if you prefer.

If you don't work with a financial advisor, that's perfectly fine - we'll walk you through everything directly.

We pre-qualify you first, then connect you with {{broker_name}} to discuss your specific situation.

Ready to get started? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today (takes about 10 minutes).
