            <p>Hi <span class="variable">{{firstName}}</span>,</p>

            <p>I'm <span class="variable">{{accountSignature}}</span> with Equity Connect.</p>

            <p>I work with homeowners over 62 who are still making mortgage payments.</p>

            <p>Most people don't realize you can eliminate your monthly payment completely - and keep your home.</p>

            <p>Your home in <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> is worth approximately <span class="variable">{{property_value}}</span>. Based on your equity, you could receive between <span class="variable">{{equity_50_percent}}</span> and <span class="variable">{{equity_60_percent}}</span>.</p>

            <p>Then never make another mortgage payment.</p>

            <p>You keep your home. No sale required. You stay right where you are.</p>

            <p>This is called a reverse mortgage - a government-insured program that over 60,000 homeowners used last year.</p>

            <p>We pre-qualify homeowners, then connect them with trusted specialists in their area. For <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span>, we work with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span> at <span class="variable">{{broker_company}}</span> (NMLS #<span class="variable">{{broker_nmls}}</span>).</p>

            <p>Want to see if you qualify? Reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes about 5-10 minutes).</p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">{{firstName}}</span>,</p>

            <p>Most people ask me: "What's the catch?"</p>

            <p>There isn't one. Here's how it works:</p>

            <p>You keep your home - no sale required<br>
            You keep the title - your name stays on it<br>
            Zero monthly payments - government-insured program<br>
            Your heirs inherit any remaining equity</p>

            <p>The only requirement: you must be 62 or older.</p>

            <p>Here's what that looks like for your situation:</p>

            <p>Current home equity: approximately <span class="variable">{{estimated_equity}}</span><br>
            Cash you could receive: <span class="variable">{{equity_50_percent}}</span> to <span class="variable">{{equity_60_percent}}</span><br>
            Your new monthly payment: $0</p>

            <p>Most homeowners with your equity level pre-qualify easily.</p>

            <p>We pre-qualify you first, then connect you with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span> at <span class="variable">{{broker_company}}</span> to discuss your specific situation.</p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">{{firstName}}</span>,</p>

            <p>Last month, I connected two homeowners in <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> with <span class="variable">{{broker_first_name}}</span>.</p>

            <p>Both had homes worth around <span class="variable">{{property_value}}</span> with good equity - similar to your situation.</p>

            <p>They both used a reverse mortgage to eliminate their monthly payments.</p>

            <p><strong>What happened:</strong></p>

            <p>A 68-year-old homeowner accessed 60% of her equity. No more payments. She's using the money for retirement income.</p>

            <p>A 72-year-old homeowner accessed 55% of his equity. Zero monthly payments. He made home improvements so he can stay in his home longer.</p>

            <p>They both kept their homes. They both have zero payments now.</p>

            <p>This is my third message about your <span class="variable">{{property_city}}</span> home.</p>

            <p>If you're interested, reply with your best phone number and we'll call you today to verify eligibility (takes 5-10 minutes).</p>

            Monthly payment after: $0</p>

            <p>Over 60,000 people did this last year. This is a government-insured program. Your home stays in your name.</p>
