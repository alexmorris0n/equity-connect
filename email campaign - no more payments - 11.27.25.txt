Subject: {{RANDOM | Quick question about your {{property_city}} mortgage | Still making payments on your {{property_city}} home? | Thought you should know this}}

{{RANDOM | Hi | Hello}} {{firstName}},
I'm {{accountSignature}} with Equity Connect.
I work with homeowners over 62 who are still making mortgage payments - {{RANDOM | often on homes they've owned for decades | sometimes on homes they've lived in for years}}.
{{RANDOM | Here's something most people don't realize | What a lot of homeowners don't know}}: if you have enough equity built up, you may be able to eliminate that monthly payment entirely - without selling or moving.
Your {{property_city}} home is worth {{RANDOM | roughly | approximately | around}} {{property_value}}, and you've built {{RANDOM | real | solid}} equity.
It's called a reverse mortgage - federally insured and used by thousands of homeowners {{RANDOM | every year | to get out from under their payment}}.
{{RANDOM | Is getting rid of your mortgage payment something you'd consider? | Is this something you've ever thought about? | Have you looked into this before?}}

Best,

EMAIL 2 - Address Skepticism
Subject: {{RANDOM | How this actually works | A few things worth knowing | Following up - your {{property_city}} home}}

{{RANDOM | Hi | Hello}} {{firstName}},
{{RANDOM | Wanted to explain | Thought I'd clarify}} how this works, since it's different from what most people expect.
You keep your home. Your name stays on the title. You {{RANDOM | just | simply}} stop making the monthly payment.
The loan gets repaid when you eventually sell or move - and any equity left over goes to you or your heirs. {{RANDOM | Nothing changes day to day | Your life stays the same}} except that payment goes away.
It's federally insured, and the money you receive isn't treated as taxable income.
A lot of homeowners use this to {{RANDOM | free up cash flow | take pressure off their monthly budget}} - especially in retirement when every dollar matters.
{{RANDOM | Any questions about how this works? | Anything you'd like me to clarify? | Does this make sense so far?}}

Best,
