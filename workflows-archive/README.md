# Archived Workflows

This folder contains workflows that have been **replaced** by the BatchData-First architecture implemented in October 2025.

## ⚠️ Important: These Are REPLACED Workflows Only

This archive only contains workflows that we **replaced with better versions**, not workflows we plan to use in the future.
