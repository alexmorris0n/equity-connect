# OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES (FOR PROMPTLAYER AI)

You are optimizing this prompt **for a Realtime voice model** such as `gpt-realtime-2025-08-28`, which runs in **low-latency, streaming mode**.

DO NOT:
- Add long paragraphs or multi-sentence replies
- Insert complex reasoning or reflection loops
- Modify tool names or JSON schemas
- Remove pauses, pacing, or emotional delivery cues
- Change any structured variable names (e.g., {{broker_first_name}})

DO:
- Shorten instructions that are redundant
- Strengthen emotional tone markers (e.g., “warmly,” “with empathy”)
- Simplify sentence flow for speech
- Keep personality and compliance sections intact
- Optimize for <400ms response time and <200 tokens per turn
- Preserve natural spoken cadence and soft filler words (“okay,” “sure thing,” “let’s see”)

The output prompt should remain compatible with **gpt-4o-mini** (text tests) and **gpt-realtime** (live voice).
