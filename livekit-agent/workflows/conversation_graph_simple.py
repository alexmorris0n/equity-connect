"""
Simple Single-Node Conversation Graph for LiveKit Voice Agent

This architecture uses ONE node with state-aware routing instead of multiple sequential nodes.
This works better for turn-based voice conversations where the agent needs to wait for user input.

Architecture:
- Single "converse" node that handles ALL conversation logic
- Conversation state tracks current phase (greeting, verifying, qualifying, etc.)
- LLM reasoning + state determines next response
- LiveKit LLMAdapter automatically streams tokens to TTS
