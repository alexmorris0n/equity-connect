Subject: {{RANDOM | Quick question about your {{property_city}} home | Your home equity - quick question | Thought you should know this}}

{{RANDOM | Hi | Hello}} {{firstName}},
I'm {{accountSignature}} with Equity Connect.
I came across your {{property_city}} property and noticed you've built {{RANDOM | solid | good | real}} equity - {{RANDOM | roughly | approximately | around}} {{estimated_equity}}.
{{RANDOM | Here's something a lot of homeowners don't realize | What many homeowners in your position don't know}}: you may be able to access between {{equity_50_percent}} and {{equity_60_percent}} of that without selling, moving, or taking on a monthly payment.
It's called a reverse mortgage - federally insured and used by thousands of homeowners {{RANDOM | every year | as a retirement tool}}.
{{RANDOM | Is this something you've thought about? | Have you ever looked into this? | Is this on your radar at all?}}

Best,

EMAIL 2 - Value Add (Practical/Lifestyle)
Subject: {{RANDOM | What people use this for | A few things worth knowing | Following up - your {{property_city}} equity}}

{{RANDOM | Hi | Hello}} {{firstName}},
{{RANDOM | Wanted to share | Thought I'd mention}} how homeowners with equity like yours typically use this.
Some use it for retirement income - a monthly deposit that {{RANDOM | supplements | adds to}} Social Security or savings. Others keep it as a line of credit for medical expenses or emergencies down the road.
A lot of folks use it for home modifications - walk-in showers, ramps, things that make it easier to stay in their home long-term.
The funds aren't treated as taxable income, and there's nothing to pay back while you live there.
{{RANDOM | Any questions about how this works? | Anything you'd like me to explain? | Want me to walk through any of this?}}

Best,
