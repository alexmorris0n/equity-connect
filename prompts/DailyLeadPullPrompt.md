READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TOOLS.
- Execute steps 1-13 in EXACT sequential order
- Do NOT skip any steps
- Do NOT execute step N until step N-1 is complete
- Validate you have required data from previous steps before proceeding

<context>
Broker: {{ $json.broker_name }} ({{ $json.broker_id }})
Daily Capacity: {{ $json.daily_capacity }}
Current Surplus: {{ $json.daily_lead_surplus }}
PropertyRadar List: {{ $json.list_id }}
Current Offset: {{ $json.current_offset }}
</context>

<workflow>

## STEP 1: Count Today's Enriched
Call execute_sql: `SELECT count_enriched_today('{{ $json.broker_id }}')`
Store as: current_count

## STEP 2: Calculate Need
Calculate: `{{ $json.daily_capacity }} - current_count - {{ $json.daily_lead_surplus }}`
Store as: needed_leads

If needed_leads <= 0: JUMP to STEP 12

If needed_leads > 0:
- Calculate: `needed_leads / 0.8` 
- Round UP
- Store as: pull_quantity

## STEP 3: Pull Properties
BEFORE executing, verify you have: pull_quantity from Step 2

Call PropertyRadar GET `/lists/{{ $json.list_id }}/items?Start={{ $json.current_offset }}&Limit=${pull_quantity}`
Store: radar_ids

## STEP 4: Filter New IDs
BEFORE executing, verify you have: radar_ids from Step 3

Call execute_sql: `SELECT * FROM filter_new_radar_ids(ARRAY['${radar_ids.join("','")}'])`
If 0 results: JUMP to STEP 12
Store: new_radar_ids

## STEP 5: Purchase Properties  
BEFORE executing, verify you have: new_radar_ids from Step 4

Call PropertyRadar POST `/properties?Purchase=1`
Body: `{"Criteria":[{"name":"RadarID","value":["${new_radar_ids.join('","')}"]}]}`
Store: properties

## STEP 6: Skip Trace
BEFORE executing, verify you have: properties from Step 5

Call batch_skip_trace with properties array:
```json
{
  "properties": [${properties.map(p => ({
    property_address: p.Address,
    property_city: p.City,
    property_state: p.State,
    property_zip: p.ZipFive,
    firstname: p.OwnerFirstName,
    lastname: p.OwnerLastName
  }))}]
}
```
Store: skiptrace_results

## STEP 7: Insert to Database
Merge properties + skiptrace_results (first contact record):
- primary_email: contacts[0].emails[0].email
- primary_phone: contacts[0].phones[0].phonenumber

For EACH lead, determine campaign_archetype using this logic:
1. If property.isFreeAndClear = 1 (or property.TotalLoanBalance = 0):
   â†’ campaign_archetype = 'cash_unlocked'  // Debt-free homeowners
   
2. Else calculate equity_pct = (estimated_equity / property_value) * 100:
   - If equity_pct >= 75%: campaign_archetype = 'high_equity_special'  // High equity, some mortgage
   - Else: campaign_archetype = 'no_more_payments'  // Active mortgage, lower equity

Execute INSERT:
```sql
INSERT INTO leads (
  radar_id, first_name, last_name, primary_email, primary_phone,
  property_address, property_city, property_state, property_zip,
  assigned_broker_id, property_value, estimated_equity, campaign_archetype
) VALUES (rows)
ON CONFLICT (addr_hash) DO NOTHING RETURNING id
```

## STEP 8: Update Offset
Call execute_sql: `SELECT update_broker_offset('{{ $json.broker_id }}', ${pull_quantity})`

## STEP 9: Get Campaigns
Call execute_sql: `SELECT archetype, instantly_campaign_id FROM campaigns WHERE active=true`
Store: campaign_map

## STEP 10: Get Uploadable Leads
Call execute_sql:
```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, primary_email, 
       property_address, property_city, property_value, estimated_equity,
       (estimated_equity::float / NULLIF(property_value,0) * 100) as equity_pct,
       campaign_archetype
FROM leads 
WHERE assigned_broker_id='{{ $json.broker_id }}' 
AND created_at AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles' >= (CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles')::timestamp
AND campaign_status IN ('new', NULL) 
AND primary_email IS NOT NULL
```
If 0: JUMP to STEP 12
Store: uploadable_leads

## STEP 11: Upload to Instantly
BEFORE executing, verify you have: uploadable_leads from Step 10, campaign_map from Step 9

GROUP leads by their campaign_archetype field.
For EACH archetype group:
1. Find the matching instantly_campaign_id from campaign_map
2. Format leads with custom_variables:
   - property_address: full address from lead
   - property_city: city from lead
   - property_value: "$XXX,XXX" with commas
   - property_value_range: "$XXXK-$XXXK" UPPERCASE K (or "$X.XM-$X.XM" if >= $1M)
   - estimated_equity: "$XXX,XXX" with commas
   - equity_50_percent: equity * 0.5 with commas
   - equity_60_percent: equity * 0.6 with commas  
   - equity_formatted_short: "$XXXK" UPPERCASE K (or "$X.XM" if >= $1M)
   - equity_percent: number
   - estimated_monthly_payment: value * 0.003 with commas
   - broker_name: "{{ $json.broker_name }}"
   - broker_nmls: "NMLS #{{ $json.broker_nmls }}"
   - campaign_name: the archetype name (e.g., "high_equity_special")
3. Call _Instantly_HTTP ONCE per archetype group with that group's leads

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT:
The leads_json parameter must be a valid JSON string containing an array.
Correct format: "[{\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"first_name\":\"John\"}]"
DO NOT add extra brackets. The string should start with "[" and end with "]" - exactly one opening and one closing bracket.

NOTE: Use "first_name" and "last_name" (underscores, not camelCase).
Each lead should ONLY be uploaded to ONE campaign based on its campaign_archetype.

## STEP 12: Mark Uploaded
Execute UPDATE:
```sql
UPDATE leads SET campaign_status='active', added_to_campaign_at=NOW()
WHERE assigned_broker_id='{{ $json.broker_id }}'
AND created_at AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles' >= (CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles')::timestamp
AND campaign_status IN ('new', NULL)
```

## STEP 13: Update Surplus
Execute UPDATE:
```sql
UPDATE brokers SET daily_lead_surplus = GREATEST(
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads 
   WHERE assigned_broker_id='{{ $json.broker_id }}'
   AND created_at AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles' >= (CURRENT_DATE AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles')::timestamp)
  - {{ $json.daily_capacity }}, 0
) WHERE id='{{ $json.broker_id }}' RETURNING daily_lead_surplus
```

<execution>
START AT STEP 1. Execute each step sequentially. Before calling any tool in step N, verify you have completed step N-1 and have all required data from previous steps.
