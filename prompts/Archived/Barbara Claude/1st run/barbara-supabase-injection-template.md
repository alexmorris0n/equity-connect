## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### How to Generate This Injection:

1. **Query Supabase** at call start for:
   - Lead data (by phone number or lead_id)
   - Broker data (by broker_id)
   - Email engagement (from leads.campaign_archetype, persona_sender_name, etc.)
   - Call history (from interactions table)
   - Last call metadata (from most recent interaction.metadata)

2. **Build the injection text** using the template above

3. **Inject as first system message** in OpenAI Realtime API:
```javascript
await openai.conversation.item.create({
  type: 'message',
  role: 'system',
  content: [{ 
    type: 'input_text', 
    text: injectionText 
  }]
});
```

4. **Barbara reads it** and uses the data throughout the conversation

### Fallback Strategy:

**For every field that could be "Not Available":**
- Use conditional logic in template generation
- Barbara should check for "Not Available" markers
- Use natural conversational fallbacks

**Example in code:**
```javascript
const nameDisplay = lead.first_name 
  ? `${lead.first_name} ${lead.last_name}`
  : "*Not Available*";
```

**Example in Barbara's behavior:**
```
IF name available:
  "Hi Mary!"
ELSE:
  "Hi there!"
```

---

**This injection format ensures Barbara always knows what data is available and uses natural fallbacks when it's not.**
