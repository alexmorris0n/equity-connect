## üéØ WHEN TO USE WHICH PROMPT

### INBOUND (Lead Calls Barbara)
```
Main Prompt + Inbound Addendum
```
**Scenarios:**
- Lead dials SignalWire number directly
- Instant callback from microsite button
- Returning caller (called before, calling again)

**Key Behaviors:**
- Greet warmly: "Thanks for calling [broker company], this is Barbara!"
- Move fast - they're warm/hot
- Less rapport-building needed
- Capture intent quickly: "What brought you to call today?"

---

### OUTBOUND (Barbara Calls Lead)
```
Main Prompt + Outbound Addendum
```
**Scenarios:**
- Email reply with phone number
- Cold email follow-up
- Scheduled callback

**Key Behaviors:**
- **WAIT FOR "HELLO?"** before speaking
- Greet with email reference: "Hi [name], this is Barbara from [broker company]. [Persona] sent you an email about..."
- Build trust FIRST - these are cold leads
- Ask permission: "Do you have a quick moment?"
- Reference campaign archetype (No More Payments, Cash Unlocked, High Equity)

---

## üîß REALTIME API OPTIMIZATIONS

### What Changed from Original Prompt?

‚ùå **REMOVED:**
- TTS pronunciation workarounds (numbers as words)
- Excessive formatting instructions
- Synchronous tool call patterns

‚úÖ **ADDED:**
- Realtime API awareness section
- VAD (Voice Activity Detection) handling
- Event-driven tool execution patterns
- Speech-to-speech native instructions
- "Wait for Hello?" protocol (outbound)

‚úÖ **IMPROVED:**
- Interruption handling (VAD auto-pauses)
- Tool narration while executing
- Natural conversation flow
- Silence handling (3-4 second patience)

---

## üí¨ SUPABASE DATA INJECTION

**This system message is injected automatically at the START of every call from Supabase database.**

### What Gets Injected:

**Always Available:**
- Call direction (inbound/outbound)
- Call type, caller type
- Broker data (name, company, NMLS, phone, ID)

**Usually Available:**
- Lead name, phone, property address
- Estimated value & equity
- Mortgage status
- Age (if PropertyRadar had it)

**Sometimes Available:**
- Email campaign archetype (no_more_payments, cash_unlocked, high_equity_special)
- Persona sender name (Linda, David, Sarah)
- Email opens/clicks
- Previous call context (money purpose, objections, timeline, key details)

### Natural Fallback Pattern:

**If data is marked "Not Available":**
- ‚úÖ Use natural conversational fallback
- ‚ùå Don't make up information

**Examples:**
- No name? ‚Üí "Hi there!" instead of "Hi [name]!"
- No campaign? ‚Üí "We sent you information..." (generic)
- No previous context? ‚Üí Ask: "What brings you to us today?"
- No age? ‚Üí Ask: "How old are you?"

## üìä KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Inbound Calls
- **Qualification rate:** 80%+ (most should qualify)
- **Appointment booking rate:** 40%+ (they're warm)
- **Time to appointment:** <5 minutes

### Outbound Calls
- **Contact rate:** 30-40% (many voicemails)
- **Qualification rate:** 50%+ (of those who answer)
- **Appointment booking rate:** 15-25% (cold leads)
- **Time to appointment:** 5-8 minutes (need trust-building)

## üö® COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: Barbara speaks too early on outbound
**Fix:** Verify "Wait for Hello?" protocol is in outbound addendum. VAD may trigger on background noise.

### Issue: Barbara doesn't reference previous call context
**Fix:** Verify CALLER INFORMATION includes `last_call_context` with metadata from `save_interaction`.

### Issue: Barbara repeats questions already answered
**Fix:** Ensure CALLER INFORMATION has complete lead data. Barbara should check before asking.

### Issue: Tools execute but Barbara doesn't narrate
**Fix:** Review "Tool Calls - Event-Driven Flow" section. Barbara should speak WHILE tools execute.

### Issue: Barbara sounds robotic
**Fix:** Emphasize "Variety" section in main prompt. Use natural Southern expressions.

## üíæ SAVE INTERACTION METADATA

**Always capture at end of call:**

```javascript
{
  money_purpose: "medical" | "home_repair" | "debt_consolidation" | "help_family" | "other",
  specific_need: "Husband needs heart surgery - $75k",
  amount_needed: 75000,
  timeline: "urgent" | "1-3_months" | "3-6_months" | "exploring",
  objections: ["fees_concern", "spouse_approval"],
  questions_asked: ["Can I leave house to kids?"],
  key_details: ["Retiring in 6 months", "Wife name is Mary"]
}
```

**This powers LAST CALL CONTEXT on future calls!**
