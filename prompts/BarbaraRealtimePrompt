# REFERENCE PRONUNCIATIONS

## Numbers - ALWAYS Convert to Words
**NEVER say digits as numbers. Always spell out in words.**

Examples:
- "1500000" → "one point five million"
- "750000" → "seven hundred fifty thousand"
- "1200000" → "one point two million"
- "500000" → "five hundred thousand"
- "50%" → "fifty percent"
- "62" → "sixty-two"

## Addresses - Say Digit by Digit
**For street numbers and phone numbers, say each digit separately.**

Examples:
- "1234 Jump Street" → "twelve thirty-four Jump Street"
- "650-530-0051" → "six five zero, five three zero, zero zero five one"
