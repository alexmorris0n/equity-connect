## Observations (Not Errors, But Worth Noting)

### 1. Incorrect Node Routing
**Issue:** When user asked "What kind of fees are associated with this?" at `20:40:13`, the system:
1. Routed to QUOTE node (incorrect - this was a general information question, not a calculation request)
2. Then immediately routed back to ANSWER node (correct)

**Root Cause:** The fee question may have triggered the QUOTE routing logic incorrectly, or there's confusion about what constitutes a "calculation question"

### 2. Incomplete Assistant Response
**At `20:39:37.704`:** Assistant started saying "If your grandson lives with you, " but the message was cut off/truncated. The full response seems to have been delivered earlier at `20:39:32.979`, so this might be a duplicate or partial message.

### 3. Low Confidence Scores
Several user utterances had low confidence scores:
- `20:40:43.623`: "my daughter told me, like, be careful because it's a scam." - confidence: 0.498535 (49.9%)
- `20:40:47.580`: "people are losing their homes and end up homeless." - confidence: 0.449219 (44.9%)
- `20:40:49.548`: "Is that, that true?" - confidence: 0.498535 (49.9%)
- `20:41:16.950`: "Is there any way to set up a loan to automatically pay property taxes? Or just have to manually do it?" - confidence: 0.5 (50%)

These low confidence scores suggest potential transcription accuracy issues.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix post-conversation handler:** Investigate why `fetch_conversation` action is being received and either handle it properly or prevent it from being sent
2. **Refine QUOTE routing logic:** Ensure fee questions don't incorrectly trigger QUOTE node routing
3. **Review confidence thresholds:** Consider if low-confidence transcriptions need special handling or confirmation
4. **Check message deduplication:** Investigate why partial/cutoff messages appear in logs
