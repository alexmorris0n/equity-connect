# CALLER INFORMATION Injection - Complete Guide

## What Gets Injected to Barbara

When Barbara gets a call, the `get_lead_context` tool pulls rich data and injects it as CALLER INFORMATION.

---

## Complete Injection Structure

```javascript
CALLER INFORMATION:
{
  // Basic lead data
  lead_id: "abc-123-def-456",
  broker_id: "broker-uuid",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Smith",
  primary_email: "john.smith@gmail.com",
  primary_phone: "+16505300051",
  
  // Property data
  property_city: "San Francisco",
  property_state: "CA",
  property_value: 1500000,
  mortgage_balance: 200000,
  estimated_equity: 1300000,
  age: 68,
  status: "contacted",
  
  // Broker data
  broker: {
    contact_name: "Walter Richards",
    company_name: "My Reverse Options",
    email: "walter@example.com",
    phone: "+16505300051",
    nmls_number: "12345"
  },
  
  // LAST CALL CONTEXT (NEW!)
  last_call: {
    money_purpose: "medical",
    specific_need: "Husband needs heart surgery - $75k",
    amount_needed: 75000,
    timeline: "urgent",
    objections: ["fees_concern", "spouse_approval"],
    questions_asked: ["Can I leave house to kids?", "What are monthly costs?"],
    key_details: ["Retiring in 6 months", "Wife name is Mary"],
    appointment_scheduled: false,
    last_outcome: "interested"
  },
  
  // Formatted context (for speaking)
  context: {
    leadName: "John",
    brokerFirstName: "Walter",
    propertyCity: "San Francisco",
    homeValueWords: "one point five million dollars",

  }
}
```

## How Barbara Uses This

### First Call (No Last Call Context)
**CALLER INFORMATION:**
```javascript
last_call: {
  money_purpose: null,
  specific_need: null,
  objections: [],
  questions_asked: [],
  key_details: []
}
```

**Barbara says:**
- "Hi John! What got you interested in learning more about reverse mortgages?"
- (Asks all qualifying questions)

**Barbara logs:**
```javascript
save_interaction({
  metadata: {
    money_purpose: "medical",
    specific_need: "Husband needs surgery - $75k",
    objections: ["fees_concern"],
    // ... etc
  }
})
```

---

### Second Call (Has Last Call Context)
**CALLER INFORMATION:**
```javascript
last_call: {
  money_purpose: "medical",
  specific_need: "Husband needs heart surgery - $75k",
  amount_needed: 75000,
  timeline: "urgent",
  objections: ["fees_concern"],
  questions_asked: ["Can I leave house to kids?"],
  key_details: ["Wife name is Mary"],
  appointment_scheduled: false,
  last_outcome: "interested"
}
```

**Barbara says:**
- "Hi John! I know you mentioned your husband needs heart surgery last time. Is that still the situation?"
- "You said the fees were a concern. Let me be very specific about how they work..."
- "I know you wanted to talk to Mary about this. Were you able to discuss it?"

**Barbara SKIPS:**
- ‚úÖ Asking what they need money for (already knows: medical)
- ‚úÖ Asking how much they need (already knows: $75k)
- ‚úÖ Re-explaining things they already asked about

---

## Prompt Instructions for Using This

### In "Build Rapport" Section:
```markdown
**Check LAST CALL CONTEXT:**
- **If purpose already known:** "I know you mentioned needing help with [specific_need from last call]. Is that still the situation?"
- **If purpose NOT known:** "What got you interested in learning more about reverse mortgages?"
```

### In "Gather Missing Information" Section:
```markdown
**CRITICAL - Check CALLER INFORMATION first:**
- Some questions may ALREADY be answered (from last_call)
- Check last_call.money_purpose, objections, etc.
- **SKIP questions you already have answers for**
```

### In "Objection Handling" Section:
```markdown
**CRITICAL:** If last_call.objections shows they already raised this objection, acknowledge: 
"I know you mentioned [objection] last time. Let me address that directly..."
```

## Implementation Flow

### Step 1: Call Starts
Barbara receives phone number from SignalWire

### Step 2: Get Lead Context
`get_lead_context({ phone: "+16505300051" })`

**Returns:**
- Lead data
- Broker data
- **Last call metadata** ‚Üê NEW!

### Step 3: Inject CALLER INFORMATION
System message sent to Barbara with all data

### Step 4: Barbara Personalizes
Barbara uses last_call data to:
- Skip redundant questions
- Reference previous objections
- Build on previous conversation
- Be contextually aware

### Step 5: Barbara Logs
At end of call, Barbara calls:
`save_interaction({ metadata: { ... } })`

### Step 6: Next Call Uses This
Next time John calls, Barbara gets his metadata and cycle repeats

## Example Personalization

### Lead's First Call:
**Barbara:** "What got you interested in reverse mortgages?"  
**Lead:** "I need money for my husband's surgery."  
**Barbara logs:** `{ money_purpose: "medical", specific_need: "Husband needs surgery" }`

### Lead's Second Call:
**CALLER INFORMATION includes:**
```javascript
last_call: {
  money_purpose: "medical",
  specific_need: "Husband needs surgery"
}
```

**Barbara:** "Hi John! I know you mentioned your husband needs surgery. Is that still the situation?"

**Lead:** "Yes, and it's urgent now - we need $75k."

**Barbara logs:** `{ money_purpose: "medical", specific_need: "Husband needs surgery - $75k", amount_needed: 75000, timeline: "urgent" }`

### Lead's Third Call:
**CALLER INFORMATION includes:**
```javascript
last_call: {
  money_purpose: "medical",
  specific_need: "Husband needs surgery - $75k",
  amount_needed: 75000,
  timeline: "urgent",
  objections: ["fees_concern"]
}
```

**Barbara:** "Hi John! I know your husband's surgery is urgent and you need that $75k. I also know the fees were a concern last time. Let me walk you through exactly how they work..."

---

## Result

**Every call builds on the last one:**
- ‚úÖ No redundant questions
- ‚úÖ Contextually aware
- ‚úÖ Addresses previous objections
- ‚úÖ Feels like continuation, not new call
- ‚úÖ Higher trust, better conversion

**Barbara remembers everything!** üß†
