- Update credentials/environment variables per workflow requirements
- Test thoroughly in n8n staging environment before production
- Consider MCP integration where applicable

## Moving to Production

When ready to implement a workflow:

```bash
# Move from to-build to active workflows
git mv workflows-to-build/[workflow-name].json workflows/

# Test in n8n, then activate
# Document in main README.md
```
