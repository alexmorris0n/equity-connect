# ✅ Campaign Setup Complete - What We Just Built

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing  
**Strategy:** Option A (Exclusive Assignment, Fresh Leads Only)

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### **1. Updated Campaign Feeder Workflow**
**File:** `workflows/campaign-feeder-daily-CLEAN.json`

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **Simplified to fresh leads only** - No rotation, no retries
- ✅ **Option A logic** - One campaign per lead based on property data
- ✅ **Added 9 new merge fields** for Instantly email personalization
- ✅ **Timestamp tracking** for 3/6/9 month re-engagement (future)
- ✅ **Updated documentation** to reflect new strategy

**Campaign Assignment Rules:**
```javascript
if (equity > $500,000) → high_equity_special
else if (isFreeAndClear === 1) → cash_unlocked
else → no_more_payments
```

**What It Does:**
1. Runs daily at 8am
2. Pulls fresh leads from `vw_campaign_ready_leads`
3. Skips any lead with existing `campaign_history`
4. Assigns campaign based on property data
5. Calculates all equity fields (50%, 60%, etc.)
6. Adds to Instantly with all merge fields
7. Updates campaign history with timestamp
8. Tracks interaction in database

---

### **2. Created SQL Migration**
**File:** `config/campaign-tracking-migration.sql`

**What It Adds:**
- ✅ **5 new tracking fields** on `leads` table
- ✅ **Updated RPC function** `add_to_campaign_history()`
- ✅ **Fresh leads view** `vw_campaign_ready_leads`
- ✅ **3 re-engagement views** (3/6/9 months)
- ✅ **Helper function** `log_lead_reply()`

**New Fields on `leads` Table:**
```sql
first_campaign_date     TIMESTAMP   -- When they first entered ANY campaign
last_campaign_date      TIMESTAMP   -- When they last entered a campaign
campaign_count          INTEGER     -- Number of times added to campaigns
last_reply_date         TIMESTAMP   -- When they last replied
last_interaction_date   TIMESTAMP   -- Any interaction (open/click/reply)
```

**Purpose:**
- Track when lead entered campaign (for re-engagement timing)
- Know when to try again (3 months, 6 months, 9 months)
- Build re-engagement workflows later

---

### **3. Created Merge Fields Reference**
**File:** `docs/INSTANTLY_MERGE_FIELDS_REFERENCE.md`

**What It Includes:**
- ✅ Complete list of all 11 merge fields
- ✅ Examples for each campaign type
- ✅ Common mistakes to avoid
- ✅ Setup instructions for Instantly
- ✅ Quick reference card

**All Merge Fields:**
```
{first_name} {last_name}
{property_address} {property_city}
{property_value} {property_value_range}
{estimated_equity}
{equity_50_percent} {equity_60_percent}
{equity_formatted_short}
{estimated_monthly_payment}
{broker_name} {broker_nmls}
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### **Step 1: Run the SQL Migration** (5 minutes)

```sql
-- Open Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy/paste contents of: config/campaign-tracking-migration.sql
-- Click "Run"
-- Verify at bottom: "✅ Campaign tracking migration complete!"
```

**This will:**
- Add 5 new fields to `leads` table
- Update `add_to_campaign_history` function
- Create `vw_campaign_ready_leads` view
- Create re-engagement views (for later)

---

### **Step 2: Import Updated Workflow to n8n** (2 minutes)

```
1. Open n8n
2. Import workflow: workflows/campaign-feeder-daily-CLEAN.json
3. Replace existing "Campaign Feeder" workflow
4. Verify connections (should be 9 nodes)
5. Save
```

**Don't activate yet** - test first!

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Instantly Custom Fields** (10 minutes)

Open Instantly → Settings → Custom Fields → Add these **exactly**:

```
property_address
property_city
property_value
property_value_range
estimated_equity
equity_50_percent
equity_60_percent
equity_formatted_short
estimated_monthly_payment
broker_name
broker_nmls
```

**Important:** Names must match exactly (case-sensitive, underscores not spaces)

---

### **Step 4: Create 3 Campaigns in Instantly** (30 minutes)

**Campaign #1: No More Payments**
- Target: Leads with mortgages
- 4 emails: Day 0, 3, 7, 14
- **NO LINKS in Day 0-7**
- Focus: Eliminate monthly payment

**Campaign #2: Cash Unlocked**
- Target: Paid-off properties  
- 4 emails: Day 0, 3, 7, 14
- **NO LINKS in Day 0-7**
- Focus: Access equity without payment

**Campaign #3: High Equity Special**
- Target: Equity > $500K
- 4 emails: Day 0, 3, 7, 14
- **NO LINKS in Day 0-7**
- Focus: Sophisticated wealth access

**Email sequence templates are in your original campaign strategy doc.**

---

### **Step 5: Update Database Campaign Config** (5 minutes)

Add campaign mappings to your `campaigns` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO campaigns (archetype, campaign_name, instantly_campaign_id) VALUES
('no_more_payments', 'No More Payments - Beverly Hills', 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID_1'),
('cash_unlocked', 'Cash Unlocked - Beverly Hills', 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID_2'),
('high_equity_special', 'High Equity Special - Beverly Hills', 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID_3');
```

**Get campaign IDs from Instantly:**
- Open campaign → Copy ID from URL
- Format: Usually looks like `abc123def456`

---

### **Step 6: Test with 10 Sample Leads** (1 hour)

**Create Test Leads:**
```sql
-- 5 leads for "No More Payments" (has mortgage)
INSERT INTO leads (...)
SET estimated_equity = 400000, isFreeAndClear = 0...

-- 3 leads for "Cash Unlocked" (paid off)
INSERT INTO leads (...)
SET estimated_equity = 350000, isFreeAndClear = 1...

-- 2 leads for "High Equity Special" (big equity)
INSERT INTO leads (...)
SET estimated_equity = 650000, isFreeAndClear = 0...
```

**Run Workflow Manually:**
1. Open workflow in n8n
2. Click "Test Workflow"
3. Watch console logs
4. Verify leads added to correct Instantly campaigns

**Check Results:**
- ✅ Leads appear in correct campaign
- ✅ All merge fields populate correctly
- ✅ `campaign_history` updated in database
- ✅ `first_campaign_date` set correctly

---

## 🎬 When Instantly/Zapmail Are Ready

### **After Tokenization Issue Resolves:**

1. **Import mailboxes to Instantly**
2. **Warm up domains** (if not already warm)
3. **Assign mailboxes to campaigns**
4. **Set sending limits** (start: 50/day per mailbox)
5. **Activate workflow** (Daily 8am trigger)

---

## 📊 What to Monitor

### **Day 1 (First 24 Hours):**
- ✅ Workflow runs at 8am successfully
- ✅ Leads assigned to correct campaigns
- ✅ Emails sending from Instantly
- ✅ No bounce errors
- ✅ Merge fields populating correctly

### **Day 3-7 (First Week):**
- 📊 Open rate (target: >25%)
- 📊 Reply rate (target: >3%)
- 📊 Sentiment distribution (70%+ positive)
- 📊 Unsubscribe rate (target: <1%)

### **Day 14+ (Ongoing):**
- 📊 Microsite visit rate (target: >60% of replies)
- 📊 Appointment booking rate (target: >20% of visitors)
- 📊 Campaign distribution (60-70% Campaign #1, 25-35% Campaign #2, 5-10% Campaign #3)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If leads aren't being added:**
```sql
-- Check if leads are in the view
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vw_campaign_ready_leads;

-- If 0, check why:
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) 
FROM leads 
WHERE campaign_history IS NULL OR campaign_history = '[]'::jsonb
GROUP BY status;
```

### **If merge fields are empty:**
- Check that field names match exactly in Instantly
- Verify data exists in database (`property_value`, `estimated_equity`)
- Check n8n execution log for calculation errors

### **If campaign assignment is wrong:**
- Check `radar_property_data` field has `isFreeAndClear` value
- Verify equity amount is accurate
- Check console logs in n8n execution

## 🎯 Key Differences from Before

### **What Changed:**

**OLD Logic:**
- Tried all 3 campaigns per lead (rotation)
- Retried non-responders with different angles
- Complex round 1/2/3 logic

**NEW Logic:**
- One campaign per lead (exclusive)
- No automatic retries
- Re-engagement handled separately later

**Why:**
- ✅ Simpler to build and test
- ✅ Cleaner data (one story per lead)
- ✅ Easier to track performance
- ✅ Separation of concerns (fresh vs re-engagement)

---

## ✅ You're Ready When...

- [ ] SQL migration ran successfully
- [ ] Updated workflow imported to n8n
- [ ] 11 custom fields created in Instantly
- [ ] 3 campaigns created with 4 emails each
- [ ] Campaign IDs added to database
- [ ] Test leads added to correct campaigns
- [ ] Merge fields populate correctly
- [ ] Instantly/Zapmail tokenization resolved

**Then:**
- [ ] Activate workflow
- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours closely
- [ ] Adjust based on metrics

## 🚧 What's NOT Done Yet (Future)

These are intentionally left for later:

1. **Reply webhook** - Auto-send microsite after positive reply
2. **AI sentiment analysis** - Classify replies as positive/negative
3. **Microsite templates** - The personalized calculator pages
4. **Appointment booking webhook** - Track $350 billing events
5. **Re-engagement workflows** - 3/6/9 month follow-ups
6. **Barbara AI integration** - Voice call follow-ups

**Why not now?**
- Focus on getting core email campaigns working first
- Reply-first strategy means we MUST get deliverability right
- Build additional features once we have baseline metrics

---

## 💬 Questions?

**If workflow errors:**
- Check n8n execution log
- Verify Supabase credentials still valid
- Check that view `vw_campaign_ready_leads` exists

**If Instantly issues:**
- Wait for tokenization to resolve (usually 1-2 hours)
- Try reconnecting one mailbox manually first
- Check API limits (Instantly dashboard)

**If data issues:**
- Verify PropertyRadar enrichment ran
- Check `estimated_equity` and `property_value` not NULL
- Run: `SELECT * FROM leads WHERE campaign_history IS NULL LIMIT 10`
