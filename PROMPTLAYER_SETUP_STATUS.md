## üîÑ How It Works (Automatic)

### When a Call Happens:

1. **Barbara talks to lead** ‚Üí Uses `prompts/old big buitifl promtp.md`
2. **Call ends** ‚Üí `audio-bridge.js` calls `save_interaction`
3. **`save_interaction` runs** ‚Üí Logs to Supabase AND PromptLayer
4. **PromptLayer receives:**
   - Full conversation transcript
   - Lead name, broker name
   - Outcome (appointment_booked, not_interested, etc.)
   - Tool calls made
   - Duration, metadata

### No Manual Steps Required!

Every Barbara call is automatically logged to PromptLayer without any code changes.

## üìä What You Get in PromptLayer Dashboard

Visit: https://promptlayer.com/dashboard

### 1. **Request Log** (All Calls)
- See every Barbara conversation
- Full transcripts
- Search by outcome, broker, lead, etc.

### 2. **Analytics**
- Cost per outcome
- Average call duration
- Success rates
- Tool usage

### 3. **Tags for Filtering**
Each call is tagged with:
```javascript
[
  'barbara',
  'realtime', 
  'appointment_booked',  // or 'not_interested', 'callback_requested', etc.
  'broker:Walter Thompson',
  'lead:John Smith'
]
```

### 4. **Metadata for Deep Analysis**
```javascript
{
  money_purpose: 'medical',
  timeline: 'asap',
  appointment_scheduled: true,
  tool_calls: ['check_broker_availability', 'book_appointment'],
  duration_seconds: 187,
  // ... 15+ more fields
}
```

## üß™ Testing (Do This After Rotating API Keys)

### Step 1: Run Test Script

```bash
# From project root
node bridge/test-promptlayer.js
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Verify API key is valid
- ‚úÖ Send test conversation to PromptLayer
- ‚úÖ Give you a request ID to find in dashboard

### Step 2: Check Dashboard

1. Go to https://promptlayer.com/dashboard
2. Click "Requests" in sidebar
3. Look for request tagged `test_successful`
4. You should see the test conversation

### Step 3: Verify Real Calls

After next Barbara call:
1. Check PromptLayer dashboard
2. Should see real call with full transcript
3. Tagged with broker/lead names
4. All metadata captured

## ‚ùå What You DON'T Need to Do

### No Prompt Changes
Your `prompts/old big buitifl promtp.md` file stays exactly the same.

PromptLayer is a **logging and analytics tool**, not a prompt replacement. Barbara talks the same way - we're just capturing the conversation for analysis.

### No Code Changes
The integration is already complete in:
- `bridge/promptlayer-integration.js` (logging functions)
- `bridge/tools.js` (auto-logs on save_interaction)
- `package.json` (dependency installed)

### No Workflow Changes
Barbara operates exactly as before. PromptLayer runs silently in the background.

## üöÄ Advanced Features (Optional - Not Set Up Yet)

These are features you CAN use but haven't configured yet:

### 1. **Prompt Registry** (Not Active)

**Benefit:** Walter could edit Barbara's responses without touching code
**Setup needed:** Move prompt to PromptLayer UI

### 2. **A/B Testing** (Not Active)
**What it does:** Test different prompt versions automatically
**Benefit:** Find optimal approach 4x faster
**Setup needed:** Create prompt variants in dashboard

### 3. **Score Tracking** (Not Active)
**What it does:** Track which prompts ‚Üí highest appointment show rates
**Benefit:** Data-driven optimization
**Setup needed:** Call `logScore()` when appointment shows up

### 4. **Real-time Tool Logging** (Partial)
**What it does:** Log each tool call as it happens (not just at end)
**Benefit:** Catch issues mid-call
**Setup needed:** Hook `logToolCall()` into audio-bridge.js
