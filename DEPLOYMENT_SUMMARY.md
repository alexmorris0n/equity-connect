## 🎓 How It Works

### Technical Architecture:

```
📞 Lead calls Barbara
    ↓
💬 Barbara: "Let me check availability..."
    ↓
🔧 Bridge calls: checkBrokerAvailability()
    ↓
🔌 Nylas Free/Busy API → Broker's calendar
    ↓
📅 Returns real available slots
    ↓
💬 Barbara: "Tuesday at 10 AM works!"
    ↓
✅ Lead confirms
    ↓
🔧 Bridge calls: bookAppointment()
    ↓
🔌 Nylas Events API → Creates calendar event
    ↓
📧 Nylas emails invite to lead
    ↓
✅ Done! Both broker and lead have calendar event
```

### Key Technologies:
- **Nylas API:** Unified calendar API (one API for Google/Outlook/iCloud)
- **Supabase Edge Functions:** Handle OAuth flow
- **n8n:** Optional workflow automation
- **Bridge:** Direct Nylas API integration
- **Vue.js:** Beautiful broker UI

## 💡 Why This is Better

### vs. Old Multi-Provider Approach:
| Old Way | Nylas Way |
|---------|-----------|
| 4 different OAuth flows | 1 OAuth flow |
| 4 different API integrations | 1 API |
| Complex switch logic | Simple API calls |
| iCloud doesn't work | Works with everything |
| Manual token refresh | Auto-refresh |
| Can't send invites | Auto-sends invites |

### vs. Cal.com:
| Cal.com | Nylas |
|---------|-------|
| $15/user/month | $9/user/month |
| External booking page | Integrated in Barbara |
| Generic booking | Real calendar sync |
| First 5 = $75/mo | First 5 = FREE |

**Nylas is 70% cheaper and better integrated!**

---

## 📊 Cost Breakdown

### Nylas Pricing:
- **Free:** Up to 5 calendar accounts
- **Paid:** $9/account/month after 5 accounts

### Your Expected Costs:
| # Brokers | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1-5       | $0 (FREE)    |
| 10        | $45          |
| 20        | $135         |
| 50        | $405         |
| 100       | $855         |

**Start FREE with first 5 brokers!**

## 🧪 Testing Plan

After deployment, test in this order:

### 1. Database Migration ✅
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_brokers_needing_calendar_sync();
```
Should return list of active brokers.

### 2. Supabase Functions ✅
```powershell
supabase functions list
```
Should show nylas-auth-url and nylas-callback.

### 3. n8n Webhook ✅
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "https://n8n.instaroute.com/webhook/broker-availability-nylas" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"broker_id":"test"}'
```
Should NOT return 404.

### 4. Broker OAuth Flow ✅
1. Have broker visit `/broker/calendar` page
2. Click "Sync Calendar"
3. Choose provider (Google/Outlook/iCloud)
4. Grant permissions
5. Verify `nylas_grant_id` saved in database

### 5. Real Call Test ✅
1. Call Barbara
2. Ask to schedule with a broker
3. Barbara checks availability
4. Barbara books appointment
5. Verify calendar invite sent
