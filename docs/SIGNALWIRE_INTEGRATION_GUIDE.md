## ðŸ“Š Call Pool Management

### Database Schema

The `call_pool` table manages SignalWire phone numbers:

```sql
CREATE TABLE call_pool (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  phone_number TEXT NOT NULL,
  signalwire_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'available' CHECK (status IN ('available', 'assigned', 'busy', 'maintenance')),
  assigned_lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id),
  assigned_broker_id UUID REFERENCES brokers(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  released_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  call_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_call_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Call Pool Workflow

1. **Lead Assignment**: When a lead is created, assign an available phone number
2. **Call Tracking**: Track all calls to the assigned number
3. **Appointment Verification**: Use call data to verify appointments
4. **Number Release**: Release the number after appointment or 24 hours

## ðŸ”§ n8n Integration

### 1. Add SignalWire Credentials

1. Go to n8n **Credentials**
2. Add new credential: **SignalWire API**
3. Enter:
   - **Project ID**: Your SignalWire project ID
   - **API Token**: Your SignalWire API token
   - **Space URL**: Your SignalWire space URL

### 2. Call Pool Management Nodes

#### Get Available Number
```json

    "limit": "1"
  }
}
```

#### Assign Number to Lead
```json
{
  "url": "https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/call_pool",
  "method": "PATCH",
  "body": {
    "status": "assigned",
    "assigned_lead_id": "{{$json.lead_id}}",
    "assigned_broker_id": "{{$json.broker_id}}",
    "assigned_at": "{{new Date().toISOString()}}"
  }
}
```

#### Release Number
```json
{
  "url": "https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/call_pool",
  "method": "PATCH",
  "body": {
    "status": "available",
    "assigned_lead_id": null,
    "assigned_broker_id": null,

- **Average Assignment Time**: How long numbers stay assigned
- **Call Volume**: Calls per number per day
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of calls that result in appointments

### 2. Lead Performance

Monitor lead performance by phone number:
- **Response Rate**: Percentage of leads that call
- **Appointment Rate**: Percentage of calls that result in appointments
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of appointments that convert

### 3. Broker Performance

Track broker performance by assigned numbers:
- **Call Handling**: How brokers handle assigned calls
- **Appointment Setting**: Success rate in setting appointments
- **Follow-up**: Follow-up call performance

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. No Available Numbers
- **Cause**: All numbers assigned, none released
- **Solution**: Implement automatic release after 24 hours
- **Prevention**: Monitor pool utilization and add more numbers

#### 2. Call Not Recording
- **Cause**: Recording not enabled on number
- **Solution**: Enable recording in SignalWire dashboard
- **Prevention**: Verify recording settings when adding numbers

#### 3. Transcription Issues
- **Cause**: Poor audio quality or language settings
- **Solution**: Check audio quality and transcription settings
- **Prevention**: Use high-quality phone numbers and clear audio

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check call pool status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM call_pool 
GROUP BY status;

-- Find numbers assigned too long
SELECT phone_number, assigned_at, 
       NOW() - assigned_at as duration
FROM call_pool 
WHERE status = 'assigned' 
  AND assigned_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Check call volume per number
SELECT phone_number, call_count, last_call_at
FROM call_pool 
ORDER BY call_count DESC;
```
