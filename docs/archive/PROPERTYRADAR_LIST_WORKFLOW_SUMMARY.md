# PropertyRadar List Workflow - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A **simplified, list-based PropertyRadar pull workflow** that replaces the complex 27-node loop-based approach with a clean 12-node linear flow.

**Files Created:**
1. `workflows/propertyradar-list-pull-worker.json` - n8n workflow (12 nodes, zero loops)
2. `config/propertyradar-list-dedup-migration.sql` - Database schema + upsert function
3. `docs/PROPERTYRADAR_LIST_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions

## Why This Approach is Better

### Old Approach (27 nodes, complex looping):
```
‚ùå Loop through brokers
  ‚ùå Loop through 31 ZIPs per broker
    ‚ùå Per-ZIP API call (31+ calls)
    ‚ùå Per-ZIP bookmarking
    ‚ùå Per-ZIP dedup checks
    ‚ùå Manual "Continue" clicks in testing
    ‚ùå Complex Split In Batches logic
    ‚ùå Repurchases same properties across runs
```

**Problems:**
- 31+ API calls per broker (expensive)
- Complex nested loops (hard to debug)
- Bookmarks per ZIP (state management nightmare)
- Repurchases properties (wasted $$$)
- Manual intervention in testing

### New Approach (12 nodes, linear flow):
```
‚úÖ Fetch active brokers
‚úÖ Get RadarIDs from dynamic list (1 call)
‚úÖ Purchase properties (1 call)
‚úÖ Upsert with dedup (radar_id, apn+fips, addr_hash)
‚úÖ Done
```

**Benefits:**
- **1 API call** per broker (vs 31+)
- **Zero loops** - n8n processes items automatically
- **No bookmarks** - list tracks state
- **No repurchases** - dedup by RadarID
- **Testable** - run manually without clicks
- **Cost-safe** - preview with Purchase=0 first

## Architecture Comparison

### Old: Per-ZIP Bookmarking
```
For each ZIP:
  1. Check bookmark (what page were we on?)
  2. Call API with Start offset
  3. Parse 50 results
  4. Check if seen before (expensive DB call)
  5. Insert leads
  6. Update bookmark
  7. Loop to next ZIP
```
**Problem:** Same properties appear in multiple runs ‚Üí repurchase same data

### New: List-Based Daily Pull
```
1. Create dynamic list once with all criteria
2. Daily: Get RadarIDs from list (new items only)
3. Purchase those specific properties
4. Upsert with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
```
**Benefit:** Only pull **new** properties added since last run

---

## Deduplication Strategy

### Triple-Layer Protection:

**Priority 1: RadarID** (PropertyRadar's unique ID)
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX leads_radar_id_uidx ON leads (radar_id);
```
Most reliable - never changes for a property.

**Priority 2: APN + County FIPS** (Assessor's Parcel Number)
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX leads_apn_fips_uidx ON leads (apn, county_fips);
```
Stable government ID - handles RadarID changes.

**Priority 3: Address Hash** (Normalized address string)
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX leads_addr_hash_uidx ON leads (addr_hash);
```
Fallback if upstream IDs are missing - `SHA256(Address|City|State|Zip)`.

**Upsert Logic:**
```sql
ON CONFLICT (radar_id) DO NOTHING
```
If any key matches, skip silently - no errors, no repurchases.

## Workflow Nodes Breakdown

### 12 Nodes (vs 27 before):

1. **Daily Trigger (6am)** - Scheduled execution
2. **Initialize Session** - Create tracking session_id
3. **Fetch Active Brokers** - Get brokers with status='active'
4. **Prepare Broker State** - Extract list_id, daily_capacity
5. **Get RadarIDs from List** - GET /lists/{id}/items (cheap)
6. **Extract RadarIDs** - Parse response
7. **Preview Purchase** - POST /properties?Purchase=0 (free preview)
8. **Check Preview** - Verify count/cost
9. **Purchase Properties** - POST /properties?Purchase=1 (actual purchase)
10. **Parse & Hash Results** - Compute dedup keys
11. **Upsert Lead** - Insert with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
12. **Final Summary** - Log completion

**Removed Nodes:**
- ‚ùå Loop Through Brokers (n8n does this automatically)
- ‚ùå Loop Through ZIPs (no longer needed)
- ‚ùå Loop Check nodes (no loops!)
- ‚ùå Get Bookmark / Update Bookmark (list handles state)
- ‚ùå Target Reached? / Skip to End (no pagination)
- ‚ùå Merge Bookmark / ZIP Complete (no loops!)
- ‚ùå Update Lead Count (implicit in array length)
- ‚ùå Broker Complete (handled by parallel execution)

## Cost Comparison

### Old Approach:
```
Per broker per day:
  31 ZIPs √ó ~8 API calls each = 248 calls
  248 calls √ó $0.75/call = $186/day
  
But: Repurchases same properties across days
  Actual cost: 248 calls √ó 30 days = 7,440 calls/month
  7,440 √ó $0.75 = $5,580/month per broker
```

### New Approach:
```
Per broker per day:
  1 list call (free) + 1 purchase call
  250 properties √ó $0.75 = $187.50/day
  
No repurchases (dedup by RadarID)
  Actual cost: 250 new properties/day √ó 30 days
  Only pay for genuinely new leads
  Estimate: 50-100 new/day avg = $37.50-$75/day
  = $1,125-$2,250/month per broker
```

**Savings: ~60-80% reduction in API costs**

## Setup Requirements

### Database (One-Time):
```bash
# Run migration
psql < config/propertyradar-list-dedup-migration.sql
```

Adds:
- `radar_id`, `apn`, `county_fips`, `addr_hash` columns
- Unique indexes for deduplication
- `propertyradar_list_id` column to brokers table
- Updated `upsert_lead_from_radar()` function

### PropertyRadar (Per Broker):
1. Create dynamic list with criteria:
   - Location: All broker ZIPs
   - Age >= 62
   - Owner Occupied
   - Available Equity >= $150k
   - Equity % >= 40%
   - AVM: $400k-$3M
   - CLTV <= 60%
   - Property Types: SFR, DPX, TPX, FPX, CND

2. Save List ID (format: `L7A8B9C0`)

3. Update broker:
```sql
UPDATE brokers 
SET propertyradar_list_id = 'L7A8B9C0'
WHERE id = 'broker-uuid';
```

### n8n:
1. Import `workflows/propertyradar-list-pull-worker.json`
2. Assign credentials (Supabase + PropertyRadar)
3. Test manually
4. Enable daily trigger

## Monitoring Queries

**Leads pulled today:**
```sql
SELECT 
  b.company_name,
  COUNT(l.id) as leads_today,
  MAX(l.created_at) as last_pull
FROM brokers b
LEFT JOIN leads l ON l.assigned_broker_id = b.id 
  AND l.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE
WHERE b.status = 'active'
GROUP BY b.id, b.company_name;
```

**Dedup effectiveness:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE radar_id IS NOT NULL) as with_radar_id,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE apn IS NOT NULL) as with_apn,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE addr_hash IS NOT NULL) as with_addr_hash,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM leads;
```

**Cost tracking:**
```sql
-- Add to workflow: store preview_cost, purchase_cost
-- Then query for monthly spend
```
