# Nylas Client Secret - What It's For

## What We're Currently Using

**✅ Currently Working with API Key Only:**
- Grant ID: `c18c3f0f-2cb2-4b39-bc87-3a72ee4f10aa`
- API Key: (from your .env file)
- **This works for:** Checking availability, booking appointments, managing events

## What the Client Secret is For

### OAuth Flow (Connecting Broker Calendars)

The **Client Secret** is ONLY needed for the **OAuth flow** - when brokers connect their Google/Microsoft calendars to your system.

**OAuth Flow:**
1. Broker clicks "Connect Calendar" in portal
2. System generates OAuth URL (needs Client ID + Client Secret)
3. Broker logs into Google/Microsoft
4. Google/Microsoft redirects back with auth code
5. System exchanges auth code for grant_id (needs Client Secret)
6. Grant_id is saved to database

**After OAuth is complete, you only need the API Key + Grant ID.**

## What You DON'T Need Client Secret For

❌ Checking availability (uses API Key + Grant ID)
❌ Booking appointments (uses API Key + Grant ID)
❌ Creating events (uses API Key + Grant ID)
❌ Reading calendars (uses API Key + Grant ID)

**Barbara's entire booking system works WITHOUT the client secret!**

## Why You Don't Have Client Secret

**Nylas Sandbox Limitation:**
- Sandbox accounts DO NOT provide `client_secret`
- This is documented Nylas behavior
- Sandbox is for API testing, not OAuth testing

## Two Paths Forward

### Option 1: Continue Without OAuth (Current Setup)
**What works:**
- ✅ Manually add grant_ids to brokers (like we did)
- ✅ Barbara checks availability and books appointments
- ✅ Full revenue flow works
- ✅ No OAuth needed

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ Brokers can't self-service connect their calendars
- ❌ You manually update grant_ids in database

### Option 2: Upgrade to Production Nylas (For OAuth)
**What you get:**
- ✅ Client Secret (for OAuth)
- ✅ Brokers can connect calendars themselves
- ✅ Supabase Edge Functions work (nylas-auth-url, nylas-callback)
- ✅ CalendarSync.vue component works
- ✅ Full self-service broker portal

**Cost:**
- Production Nylas account (check pricing)

## Current Status

**You DON'T need the client secret right now because:**
1. You're manually managing grant_ids (works fine)
2. Barbara's booking system is fully functional
3. Revenue flow is working end-to-end

**You WILL need the client secret when:**
1. You want brokers to connect their own calendars
2. You deploy the broker portal calendar sync UI
3. You want self-service calendar management

## Recommendation

**For now:** Keep using API Key + manually managed grant_ids
**Later:** Upgrade to production Nylas when you need broker self-service

**Bottom line: You don't need it yet. Barbara works completely without it!** ✅
