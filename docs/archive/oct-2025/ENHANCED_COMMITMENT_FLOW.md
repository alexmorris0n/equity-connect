# Enhanced Commitment Flow (7 Points)

## What We Added (Without Waiting)

### 1. âœ… Confirm Time
**Barbara:** "So just to confirm, you're all set for Tuesday, October 22nd at 10 AM. Does that work for you?"
- First commitment point

### 2. âœ… Build Accountability
**Barbara:** "Great! Walter is looking forward to speaking with you then."
- Personalizes the broker

### 3. âœ… What to Expect (NEW!)
**Barbara:** "Let me tell you what to expect on the call. Walter is going to walk you through exactly how much cash you could access from your home - we're talking about that six hundred eighty thousand dollars. The call usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes. Sound good?"

**Psychology:**
- Invests mental energy (sunk cost)
- Creates anticipation with specific numbers
- Makes future concrete
- Gets another "yes" ("Sound good?")

### 4. âœ… Preparation Request (NEW!)
**Barbara:** "Here's what will make this really valuable for you - before the call, just think about what you'd want to do with that money. Is it travel? Home improvements? Helping family? Walter can tailor the options to what matters most to you."

**Psychology:**
- Gives them homework (creates obligation)
- Makes them mentally invest
- No waiting needed - just flows naturally

### 5. âœ… Check for Barriers (NEW!)
**Barbara:** "Is there anything that might come up that could make you miss this call? Sometimes people have appointments or other commitments..."

**Lead:** "No, I'm all clear."

**Barbara:** "Perfect! So I can count on you being available, right?"

**Psychology:**
- Removes excuses in advance
- Forces them to think about conflicts NOW
- Gets another "yes"

### 6. âœ… Text Reminder with Reply Request (ENHANCED!)
**Barbara:** "Can I send you a quick text reminder the day before so you don't forget?"

**Lead:** "Sure."

**Barbara:** "Perfect! You'll get a text on Monday to remind you. **Just reply YES to that text to confirm you're all set.**"

**Psychology:**
- Gets consent for text (TCPA)
- Sets expectation for future commitment (reply YES)
- Another action point

### 7. âœ… Final Commitment (ENHANCED!)
**Barbara:** "Now, John, Walter is setting aside this time specifically for you **and preparing your equity analysis**. Can I count on you to be available when they call?"

**Lead:** "Yes, absolutely."

**Barbara:** "Wonderful! I really appreciate that. Walter will have some great options for you."

**Psychology:**
- "Preparing your equity analysis" = work being done for them
- Creates guilt if they no-show
- Final verbal commitment
