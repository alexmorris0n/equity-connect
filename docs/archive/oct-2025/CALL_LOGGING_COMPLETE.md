# Call Logging to Supabase - Complete

## ✅ What's Already Done

### 1. Database Schema
**Table:** `interactions`  
**Metadata Column:** `metadata` (JSONB) - Already exists!

**What it stores:**
- Call context (money purpose, timeline, needs)
- Objections raised
- Questions asked
- Key details mentioned
- Appointment status
- Contact verification status
- Commitment points completed
- Tool calls made

### 2. Updated Function
**File:** `bridge/tools.js`  
**Function:** `saveInteraction()` (Line 939)

**Now captures:**
```javascript
metadata: {
  // Lead context
  money_purpose: "medical",
  specific_need: "Husband needs surgery - $75k",
  amount_needed: 75000,
  timeline: "urgent",
  
  // Objections
  objections: ["fees_concern", "spouse_approval"],
  
  // Questions
  questions_asked: ["Can I leave house to kids?"],
  
  // Details
  key_details: ["Retiring in 6 months", "Wife is Mary"],
  
  // Appointment
  appointment_scheduled: true,
  appointment_datetime: "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z",
  
  // Verification
  email_verified: true,
  phone_verified: true,
  
  // Commitment
  commitment_points_completed: 8,
  text_reminder_consented: true,
  
  // Quality
  tool_calls_made: ["check_broker_availability", "book_appointment"]
}
```

### 3. Migration Documentation
**File:** `database/migrations/20251021_interaction_metadata_schema.sql`

**Includes:**
- Complete metadata schema documentation
- Example queries
- Optional index suggestions
- No migration needed (column already exists!)

## How It Works

### During Call:
**Barbara collects information:**
- Lead says: "I need money for my husband's surgery"
- Lead says: "I'm worried about the fees"
- Lead asks: "Can I leave the house to my kids?"

### End of Call:
**Barbara calls `save_interaction`:**
```javascript
save_interaction({
  lead_id: "abc-123",
  broker_id: "broker-456",
  duration_seconds: 180,
  outcome: "appointment_booked",
  content: "Lead interested in reverse mortgage for medical expenses. Booked Tuesday 10 AM.",
  
  metadata: {
    money_purpose: "medical",
    specific_need: "Husband needs heart surgery - $75k",
    amount_needed: 75000,
    timeline: "urgent",
    objections: ["fees_concern"],
    questions_asked: ["Can I leave house to kids?"],
    key_details: ["Wife name is Mary"],
    appointment_scheduled: true,
    appointment_datetime: "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z",
    email_verified: true,
    phone_verified: true,
    commitment_points_completed: 8,
    text_reminder_consented: true
  }
})
```

### Saved to Supabase:
```sql
INSERT INTO interactions (
  lead_id,
  broker_id,
  type,
  direction,
  content,
  duration_seconds,
  outcome,
  metadata  -- Rich JSONB metadata here!
)
```

### Next Call (Context Retrieval):
**Barbara can query:**
```javascript
get_lead_context({ phone: "+16505300051" })
```

**Returns interaction history with metadata:**
```javascript
{
  last_call: {
    money_purpose: "medical",
    specific_need: "Husband needs surgery - $75k",
    objections: ["fees_concern"],
    // ... all the metadata
  }
}
```

**Barbara uses it:**
"Hi John! I know you mentioned your husband needs surgery last time. Is that still the situation?"

## Analytics You Can Now Run

### 1. Most Common Money Purposes
```sql
SELECT 
  metadata->>'money_purpose' as purpose,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM interactions
WHERE metadata ? 'money_purpose'
GROUP BY metadata->>'money_purpose'
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### 2. Most Common Objections
```sql
SELECT 
  jsonb_array_elements_text(metadata->'objections') as objection,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM interactions
WHERE metadata ? 'objections'
GROUP BY objection
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### 3. Average Commitment Points (Quality Metric)
```sql
SELECT 
  AVG((metadata->>'commitment_points_completed')::int) as avg_commitment_points,
  outcome
FROM interactions
WHERE metadata ? 'commitment_points_completed'
GROUP BY outcome;
```

### 4. Text Reminder Consent Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN metadata->>'text_reminder_consented' = 'true' THEN 1 END)::float / COUNT(*) * 100 as consent_rate
FROM interactions
WHERE outcome = 'appointment_booked';
```

### 5. Urgent Timeline Leads (For Priority Follow-Up)
```sql
SELECT 
  lead_id,
  metadata->>'specific_need' as need,
  metadata->>'amount_needed' as amount,
  created_at
FROM interactions
WHERE metadata->>'timeline' = 'urgent'
  AND outcome != 'appointment_booked'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Next Call Personalization Examples

**Scenario 1: They Raised Fees Concern**
```javascript
// Previous call metadata:
{ objections: ["fees_concern"] }

// Next call, Barbara says:
"Hi John! I know the fees were a concern last time. Let me be very specific about how they work..."
```

**Scenario 2: They Needed Spouse Approval**
```javascript
// Previous call metadata:
{ 
  objections: ["spouse_approval"],
  key_details: ["Wife name is Mary"]
}

// Next call, Barbara says:
"Hi John! I know you needed to talk to Mary about this. Were you able to discuss it?"
```

**Scenario 3: Urgent Medical Need**
```javascript
// Previous call metadata:
{
  money_purpose: "medical",
  specific_need: "Husband needs surgery - $75k",
  timeline: "urgent"
}

// Next call, Barbara says:
"Hi John! I know your husband needs surgery soon. I have some great news about how quickly we can get you that $75,000..."
```
