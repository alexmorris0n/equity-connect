### ⭐ **NEW: Custom Instructions from n8n**

Bridge now supports **dynamic personalized prompts** from n8n:
- n8n builds custom Barbara prompt per lead
- Static part cached by OpenAI (50% cost reduction)
- Dynamic part personalized (lead name, broker, property info)
- Full control from n8n (update prompts without redeploying bridge)

See `N8N_BARBARA_WORKFLOW.md` for complete workflow setup.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Complete Flow

```
📧 Lead replies to email
    ↓
🔀 n8n workflow detects reply
    ↓
📞 n8n → POST https://your-bridge.northflank.app/start-call
         { to, from, lead_id, broker_id }
    ↓
📡 Bridge → SignalWire REST API
         "Place call to lead"
    ↓
☎️  SignalWire dials lead
    Lead answers
    ↓
📄 SignalWire → GET /public/outbound-xml
    Returns: <Connect><Stream wss://bridge/audiostream /></Connect>
    ↓
🔌 SignalWire opens WebSocket to bridge
    ↓
🤖 Bridge opens WebSocket to OpenAI Realtime
    Configures Barbara's session + tools
    ↓
🗣️  Barbara ↔ Lead conversation
    
    During call:
    - get_lead_context() → Fetch lead info from Supabase
    - check_consent_dnc() → Verify calling permissions
    - update_lead_info() → Save collected data
    - book_appointment() → Schedule with broker
    ↓
📊 Call ends
    save_interaction() → Log to Supabase
    ↓
✅ n8n can trigger follow-up workflows
```

**Example:** Gets lead name, property city, home value

### 2. `check_consent_dnc`
**Parameters:** `{ lead_id }`  
**Returns:** `{ can_call: boolean, has_consent, is_dnc }`  
**Example:** Verifies lead gave consent, not on DNC list

### 3. `update_lead_info`
**Parameters:** `{ lead_id, last_name, property_value, age, ... }`  
**Returns:** `{ success: true, updated_fields }`  
**Example:** Saves info collected during call

### 4. `book_appointment`
**Parameters:** `{ lead_id, broker_id, scheduled_for, notes }`  
**Returns:** `{ success: true, appointment_id }`  
**Example:** Creates interaction + billing_event in Supabase

### 5. `save_interaction`
**Parameters:** `{ lead_id, broker_id, duration_seconds, outcome, content }`  
**Returns:** `{ success: true, interaction_id }`  
**Example:** Logs call at end with transcript summary

## 🔍 Testing Checklist (Tomorrow)

### Inbound Call Test
- [ ] Call connects to SignalWire number
- [ ] Barbara greets caller
- [ ] Audio is clear (both directions)
- [ ] Barbara responds naturally to questions
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation works
- [ ] Call logs to Supabase `interactions` table

### Outbound Call Test
- [ ] n8n/curl triggers call successfully
- [ ] SignalWire places call to lead
- [ ] Lead answers, Barbara introduces herself
- [ ] Audio quality is good
- [ ] Conversation flows naturally
- [ ] Interaction saved to database

### Tool Execution Test
- [ ] `get_lead_context` - Barbara knows lead name
- [ ] `check_consent_dnc` - Consent verified before call
- [ ] `update_lead_info` - Data collected (age, address, etc.)
- [ ] `book_appointment` - Appointment created in DB
- [ ] `save_interaction` - Call logged at end

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Verify calls logged
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM interactions 
WHERE type = 'ai_call' 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Verify appointments created
SELECT * FROM interactions 
WHERE type = 'appointment' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Verify billing events
SELECT * FROM billing_events 
WHERE event_type = 'appointment_set' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: No audio on call

**Check:**
1. OpenAI API key is correct
2. `BRIDGE_URL` is HTTPS (not HTTP)
3. Northflank logs show `✅ OpenAI session configured`

**Fix:**
- Verify API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Update `BRIDGE_URL` in environment variables
- Redeploy service

### Issue: Tools not working

**Check:**
1. Using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (not anon key)
2. Tables exist: `leads`, `brokers`, `interactions`
3. Logs show `🔧 Tool called`

**Fix:**
- Get service key: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
- Verify tables exist in Table Editor
- Check RLS policies allow service role

### Issue: Calls dropping after 30 seconds

**Check:**
1. Northflank service is running
2. Memory usage via `/healthz` endpoint
3. WebSocket errors in logs

**Fix:**
- Increase memory allocation (Northflank settings)
- Check for memory leaks in logs
- Review active connections count

### Issue: SignalWire not connecting

**Check:**
1. Voice URL is correct in SignalWire dashboard
2. URL is publicly accessible
3. Using `GET` method (not POST)

**Fix:**
- Test URL: `curl https://your-bridge/public/inbound-xml`
- Should return XML with `<Connect><Stream>`
- Check Northflank deployment logs

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Audio Format
- **SignalWire**: L16@16000h (16-bit linear PCM @ 16kHz)
- **OpenAI**: pcm16 @ 16kHz
- **Perfect match** - no transcoding needed ✅

### Number Formatting
All numbers converted to words to prevent TTS pitch changes:
- `750000` → "seven hundred fifty thousand"
- `1500000` → "one point five million"
- `50%` → "fifty percent"
- `+14155556565` → "four one five, five five five, six five six five"

### SignalWire LaML Optimization
```xml
<Stream 
  url="wss://bridge/audiostream"
  codec="L16@16000h"      <!-- Explicit 16kHz PCM -->
  track="both_tracks"     <!-- Bidirectional audio -->
  realtime="true"         <!-- Low-latency mode -->
/>
```

### OpenAI Realtime Session
```javascript
{
  modalities: ['audio', 'text'],
  voice: 'alloy',
  instructions: BARBARA_PROMPT,
  input_audio_format: 'pcm16',
  output_audio_format: 'pcm16',
  turn_detection: { type: 'server_vad' },
  tools: [5 Supabase function definitions]
}
```
