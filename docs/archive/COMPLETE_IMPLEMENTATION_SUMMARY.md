### 3. Update n8n Workflow (60 minutes)

**Once you have all 3 API keys**, I can update the workflow for you, OR you can manually add these nodes following `workflows/ATTOM-property-pull-worker.md`:

**New nodes to add:**
1. "Select Current Zip" (Code node after Get Bookmark)
2. "ATTOM Property Lookup" (HTTP Request) - Replace BatchData node
3. "Extract & Normalize ATTOM" (Code node)
4. "IF Needs Enrichment?" (Conditional)
5. "PDL Person Enrich" (HTTP Request)
6. "Parse PDL Response" (Code node)
7. "IF PDL Hit?" (Conditional)
8. "Melissa Contact Append" (HTTP Request)
9. "Parse Melissa Response" (Code node)
10. "Update Enrichment" (HTTP Request to Supabase RPC)

**Nodes to update:**
- "Upsert Lead" ‚Üí use `upsert_lead_from_attom` RPC
- "Advance Bookmark" ‚Üí handle zip rotation

---

## üí∞ Expected Economics

### Cost Per Lead (Blended Average)

**Scenario breakdown:**
```
60% PDL Hit:     ATTOM ($0.10) + PDL ($0.05) = $0.15
30% Melissa Hit: ATTOM ($0.10) + PDL ($0.05) + Melissa ($0.15) = $0.30
10% No Contact:  ATTOM ($0.10) + PDL ($0.05) + Melissa ($0.15) = $0.30 (DLQ)

Blended: (0.60 √ó $0.15) + (0.30 √ó $0.30) + (0.10 √ó $0.30) = $0.21/lead
```

### Monthly Projections (250 leads/day)

```
Daily:   250 leads √ó $0.21 = $52.50
Monthly: 7,500 leads √ó $0.21 = $1,575
```

### vs BatchData (What We Avoided)

```
BatchData monthly cost: $186,000+
ATTOM+PDL+Melissa:      $1,575
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
SAVINGS:                $184,425/month (99.2% reduction)
```

## üìä Expected Hit Rates

| Provider | Hit Rate | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **ATTOM** | 100% | All properties in LA zip codes returned |
| **PDL (Tier-1)** | 40-60% | Email/phone found for most homeowners |
| **Melissa (Tier-2)** | +20-30% | Catches PDL misses with verified append |
| **Total Enrichment** | 70-85% | Leads with verified email OR phone |
| **DLQ Rate** | 10-15% | Leads with no contact after both tiers |

---

## üîÑ Workflow Execution Flow

### Single Run Example (1 Zip Code)

```
1. Fetch broker territories ‚Üí 32 zips for Walter Richards
2. Get bookmark ‚Üí { last_page_fetched: 0, zip_index: 0 }
3. Select current zip ‚Üí 90016 (zip_codes[0])
4. ATTOM lookup ‚Üí postalcode=90016&page=1&pagesize=50
   Cost: $5 (50 properties √ó $0.10)
5. Extract properties ‚Üí 42 qualify (50%+ equity filter)
6. Upsert to Supabase ‚Üí 42 new leads inserted
7. Enrich with PDL ‚Üí 25 hits (60% hit rate)
   Cost: $2.10 (42 √ó $0.05)
8. Enrich with Melissa ‚Üí 7 hits from 17 PDL misses (41% hit rate)
   Cost: $2.55 (17 √ó $0.15)
9. Total enriched: 32 leads with contact (76% enrichment rate)
10. Advance bookmark ‚Üí { last_page_fetched: 1, zip_index: 0 }

Total cost: $5.00 + $2.10 + $2.55 = $9.65
Total leads: 42 raw, 32 enriched
Cost per enriched lead: $0.30
```

### Next Run (Same Zip, Page 2)

```
1. Get bookmark ‚Üí { last_page_fetched: 1, zip_index: 0 }
2. Select current zip ‚Üí 90016 (still same zip)
3. ATTOM lookup ‚Üí postalcode=90016&page=2&pagesize=50
   Cost: $5 (50 more properties)
4. ... enrichment continues ...
```

### When Zip Exhausted (<50 results)

```
1. ATTOM returns only 15 properties (last page)
2. Advance bookmark ‚Üí { last_page_fetched: 0, zip_index: 1 }
   (Rotates to next zip, resets page counter)
3. Next run processes zip 90018 (zip_codes[1])
```

## üí° Key Insights from BatchData Failure

**What we learned:**
1. ‚ùå **Search APIs with upfront result-set billing don't work for incremental pulls**
2. ‚úÖ **Lookup/Detail APIs with per-record billing are essential**
3. ‚úÖ **Always test with 1-2 records before scaling**
4. ‚úÖ **Read the fine print on billing models (not just pricing tables)**
5. ‚úÖ **Field limiting doesn't reduce cost if you're charged for entire result set**

**Cost of lesson:** $31 (totally worth it to avoid $186,000/month disaster!)
