# Equity Connect - Master Production Plan

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Current Phase:** AI Agentic Workflows Deployed - 5 Workflows Replaced by 1 AI Agent

---

## 🎯 System Overview

Equity Connect is an AI-powered lead generation and nurturing platform for reverse mortgage brokers. The system uses AI agents to autonomously pull qualified property leads, enrich them with contact data, and manage compliant multi-channel outreach campaigns.

**Key Innovation:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture enables one AI agent to orchestrate 4+ external services, replacing 135 deterministic workflow nodes with 13 intelligent nodes.

**Tech Stack:**
- **AI:** Claude Haiku 3 via OpenRouter
- **Orchestration:** n8n (self-hosted)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Data Sources:** PropertyRadar API, BatchData API
- **Outreach:** Instantly.ai (email), VAPI.ai (voice)
- **Integration:** MCP servers for Supabase, Instantly, VAPI

## 📘 Campaign System Quick Reference

### How Campaign Rotation Works

**Round 1 (First Contact):**
- Lead gets data-driven archetype assignment
- High equity ($500k+) → "High Equity Special"
- Debt-free (isFreeAndClear=1) → "Cash Unlocked"
- Has mortgage → "No More Payments"

**Round 2 (14 days later, no reply):**
- Workflow checks `campaign_history`
- Assigns first untried archetype from sequence
- Example: Tried "No More Payments" → Try "Cash Unlocked"

**Round 3 (28 days later, still no reply):**
- Assigns second untried archetype
- Example: Tried both above → Try "High Equity Special"

**Exhausted (42 days, no reply):**
- Lead tried all 3 angles
- Workflow skips lead (returns empty array)
- Can manually reset `campaign_history` to retry

### Managing Campaign IDs

**To add Instantly campaign IDs:**
```sql
UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'your-instantly-uuid-here' 
WHERE archetype = 'no_more_payments';

UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'another-uuid' 
WHERE archetype = 'cash_unlocked';

UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'third-uuid' 
WHERE archetype = 'high_equity_special';
```

**To check campaign history for a lead:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, campaign_history 
FROM leads 
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid';
```

**To reset a lead's campaign history (retry all 3):**
```sql
UPDATE leads 
SET campaign_history = '[]', 
    campaign_archetype = NULL,
    added_to_campaign_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid';
```

**To see campaign distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
  campaign_archetype,
  COUNT(*) as lead_count
FROM leads
WHERE campaign_archetype IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY campaign_archetype;
```
