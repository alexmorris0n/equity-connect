# Session Summary - October 11, 2025

**Duration:** ~6 hours  
**Status:** PropertyRadar Pull Workflow COMPLETE ✅  
**Next:** Enrichment workflows (Saturday)

---

## 🎯 What We Built

### PropertyRadar List-Based Pull Workflow (PRODUCTION READY)

**File:** `workflows/propertyradar-list-pull-worker.json`  
**n8n Workflow ID:** CTJmLVrXOJ4kqRRx  
**Nodes:** 17 (simplified from original 27-node ZIP-loop approach)

**What it does:**
- Pulls 250 properties/day per broker from PropertyRadar dynamic lists
- Triple deduplication (saves ~$187/day)
- Auto-advancing pagination (currently at offset 250 of 52,823)
- Multi-broker parallel processing
- Queues 250 enrichment events per broker

**Test Results:**
- ✅ 250 properties purchased from PropertyRadar
- ✅ 250 leads inserted to database
- ✅ 250 enrichment events queued
- ✅ Offset correctly updated (0 → 250)
- ✅ Avg property value: $873k, equity: $692k
- ✅ Execution time: 41 seconds

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Functions Created:
1. **`filter_new_radar_ids(ids text[])`** - Pre-purchase dedup filter
2. **`broker_leads_today(p_broker uuid)`** - Daily capacity tracking
3. **`update_broker_offset(p_broker_id uuid, p_increment int)`** - Pagination tracking
4. **`upsert_lead_from_radar(p jsonb)`** - Updated with new columns

### New Columns Added to `leads`:
- `radar_id` TEXT (PropertyRadar unique ID)
- `apn` TEXT (assessor parcel number)
- `county_fips` TEXT (county FIPS code)
- `addr_hash` TEXT (address hash for dedup)
- `phone_available` BOOLEAN (PropertyRadar flag)
- `email_available` BOOLEAN (PropertyRadar flag)
- `primary_email` TEXT (actual email address)
- `primary_phone` TEXT (actual phone number)

### New Columns Added to `brokers`:
- `propertyradar_list_id` TEXT (dynamic list ID, e.g., "1104668")
- `propertyradar_offset` INTEGER (pagination position)

## 🧹 Documentation Cleanup

### Created New Master Docs:
- **`docs/MASTER_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md`** - Single source of truth
- **`docs/README.md`** - Documentation index
- **`docs/WEEKEND_ROADMAP.md`** - Sat/Sun/Mon tasks
- **`docs/COMPLIANCE_SIMPLE_GUIDE.md`** - Email vs call rules
- **`docs/PROPERTYRADAR_PULL_WORKFLOW_FINAL.md`** - Workflow details

### Fixed Compliance Misunderstandings:
- **INSTANTLY_CONSENT_INTEGRATION.md** - Removed incorrect consent forms from cold emails
- **CONSENT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md** - Clarified ONLY for phone calls after reply

### Archived 15 Historical Docs:
- Old phase completion summaries
- Old implementation summaries
- Redundant PropertyRadar guides
- Gap analysis docs

### Deleted 9 Obsolete Docs:
- Interim workflow update plans
- Failed approach documentation
- Debug/troubleshooting docs from old workflows

**Result:** 76 → 30 active docs (60% reduction)

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. Split In Batches Loop Issues
**Problem:** ZIP-loop workflow wouldn't iterate through territories  
**Root Cause:** Missing `batchSize: 1` parameter, complex loop-back connections  
**Solution:** Eliminated loops entirely - use PropertyRadar dynamic lists instead

### 2. Crypto Module Errors
**Problem:** `require('crypto')` disallowed in n8n Code nodes  
**Solution:** Replaced with simple JavaScript hash function

### 3. Offset Bug (62,500 instead of 250)
**Problem:** Update Broker Offset ran 250 times, incrementing each time  
**Solution:** Added aggregation node to combine 250 items → 1 before offset update

### 4. Supabase Node Misuse
**Problem:** Used `executeQuery` operation (doesn't exist in v1)  
**Solution:** Use HTTP Request nodes for RPC calls, Supabase nodes for table operations

### 5. Missing Bookmark ID
**Problem:** `get_or_create_bookmark()` didn't return `id` field  
**Solution:** Updated function to return all fields including `id`

## 📊 Current System Status

### ✅ Working Components:
- PropertyRadar dynamic list (List ID: 1104668, 52,823 properties)
- PropertyRadar pull workflow (250 leads/day per broker)
- Database deduplication (triple-layer)
- Enrichment queue (250 events pending)
- Broker configuration (My Reverse Options broker fully configured)

### 🔄 In Progress (This Weekend):
- PropertyRadar `/persons` enrichment workflow
- PDL fallback enrichment workflow
- Instantly campaign setup

### 📅 Planned (Next Week):
- Reply handler + consent forms
- VAPI voice integration
- Cal.com appointment booking

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Simplicity Wins
**Failed:** 27-node ZIP-loop workflow with Split In Batches  
**Succeeded:** 17-node list-based workflow with n8n's native item processing

### 2. Use Native Features
**Failed:** Complex looping with Split In Batches + manual reconnections  
**Succeeded:** Let n8n automatically process multiple items in parallel

### 3. Modular > Monolithic
**Failed:** One giant enrichment workflow trying to do everything  
**Succeeded:** Separate pull, enrichment, and campaign workflows

### 4. Test Incrementally
**Failed:** Build entire workflow, test at end, debug for hours  
**Succeeded:** Test each node individually, fix as you go

### 5. Read The Docs
**Failed:** Assumed `executeQuery` existed in Supabase node  
**Succeeded:** Checked n8n Supabase docs, used correct operations

## 🚀 Weekend Plan

### Saturday (Enrichment):
**Goal:** 220+ of 250 leads have emails

1. Build PropertyRadar `/persons` workflow
   - Call `/v1/properties/{RadarID}/persons?Purchase=1&Fields=default`
   - Extract: NameFull, Emails, Phones
   - Update leads: first_name, last_name, primary_email
   - Expected: 70% coverage (~175 emails)

2. Build PDL fallback workflow
   - Input: address + name (from PropertyRadar)
   - Call PDL Person Enrichment API
   - Extract: email
   - Update leads: primary_email
   - Expected: 60% of remainder (~45 more emails)

**Total expected:** 220 of 250 with emails (88%)

### Sunday (Campaign Setup):
**Goal:** First 50 leads sent to Instantly

1. Configure Instantly campaign
   - Create "Reverse Mortgage - Initial Outreach" campaign
   - Add custom fields (broker_name, property_address, equity)
   - Write 3-email sequence (Day 0, Day 3, Day 7)

2. Test campaign feeder
   - Run `campaign-feeder-daily.json` manually
   - Send 10 test leads to Instantly
   - Verify personalization works
   - Check emails deliver correctly

### Monday (Reply Handler):
**Goal:** Consent forms working for interested leads

1. Build Instantly reply webhook
   - Trigger on reply received
   - Parse reply text for positive intent
   - Generate consent token
   - Send follow-up email with consent form

2. Build consent form handler
   - Accept form submission
   - Record consent in database (consent=true, consented_at=now())
   - Mark lead as callable
   - Notify broker of consented lead
