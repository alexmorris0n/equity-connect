## STEP 1: Query Database for Lead (UPDATED - ALL FIELDS)

Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
SELECT 
  l.id, 
  l.first_name, 
  l.last_name, 
  l.primary_email, 
  l.primary_phone, 
  l.status,
  l.property_address,
  l.property_city,
  l.property_state,
  l.property_zip,
  l.property_value,
  l.estimated_equity,
  l.campaign_archetype,
  l.assigned_persona,
  l.persona_sender_name,
  b.id as broker_id,
  b.company_name as broker_company,
  b.contact_name as broker_contact_name,
  b.nmls_number as broker_nmls,
  b.phone as broker_phone
FROM leads l 
LEFT JOIN brokers b ON l.assigned_broker_id = b.id 
WHERE l.primary_email = '{{ $json.lead_email }}' 
LIMIT 1
```

If no result: output "Lead not found for {{ $json.lead_email }}" and STOP
Store result as: lead_record

---

## STEP 2: Classify Reply Intent & Execute Workflow

Analyze {{ $json.reply_text }} to determine intent (check in this order):

**1. PHONE_PROVIDED** - Contains 10-digit phone number (XXX-XXX-XXXX, (XXX) XXX-XXXX, etc.)

**2. UNSUBSCRIBE** - Contains: "unsubscribe", "remove me", "stop emailing", "opt out", "not interested"

**3. QUESTION** - Contains question words: what, how, when, where, why + question mark

**4. INTEREST** - Contains: "interested", "tell me more", "sounds good", "more info"

Store as: intent

**CRITICAL: After classifying intent, immediately proceed to STEP 3 and execute ALL required actions for that intent. DO NOT stop after classification.**

---

## STEP 3: Execute Based on Intent

### IF PHONE_PROVIDED:

**3A. Extract phone number:**
Search {{ $json.reply_text }} for phone, extract 10 digits, format as XXX-XXX-XXXX
Store as: extracted_phone

**3B. Update database:**
Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
UPDATE leads SET 
  primary_phone = '${extracted_phone}', 
  status = 'qualified', 
  persona_sender_name = '{{ $json.persona_sender_name }}',
  last_reply_at = NOW() 
WHERE primary_email = '{{ $json.lead_email }}' 
RETURNING id
```

**3C. Trigger Barbara Call (VAPI MCP):**
First, convert phone to E.164 format:
- If ${extracted_phone} is "650-530-0051", convert to "+16505300051" (add +1, remove dashes)

**3C. Create VAPI Call with SignalWire Number Pool:**
**3C1. Query Database for Available SignalWire Phone Numbers:**
Call Supabase execute_sql to get available SignalWire phone numbers for the lead's territory:

```sql
SELECT 
  vapi_phone_number_id,
  number,
  name,
  territories,
  status,
  assigned_broker
FROM signalwire_phone_numbers 
WHERE status = 'active' 
  AND (territories @> '["${lead_record.property_state}"]' OR territories IS NULL)
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN territories @> '["${lead_record.property_state}"]' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END,
  RANDOM()
LIMIT 1
```

If no result: Use fallback SignalWire number "45b2f2bb-5d0f-4c96-b43f-673584207d9d"
Store the vapi_phone_number_id as: selected_phone_number_id

**3C2. Assign Phone Number to Lead:**
Update the lead record to assign the phone number:
```sql
UPDATE leads SET assigned_phone_number_id = '${selected_phone_number_id}', phone_assigned_at = NOW() WHERE id = '${lead_record.id}' RETURNING id
```

**3C3. Create Call with ALL 28 VARIABLES (SIGNALWIRE VERSION):**
The VAPI MCP Server is connected. Call create_call with these EXACT parameters:
```json
{
  "assistantId": "cc783b73-004f-406e-a047-9783dfa23efe",
  "phoneNumberId": "${selected_phone_number_id}",
  "customer": {
    "phoneNumber": "+1${extracted_phone_digits_only}"
  },
  "assistantOverrides": {
    "variableValues": {
      "lead_first_name": "${lead_record.first_name || 'there'}",
      "lead_last_name": "${lead_record.last_name || ''}",
      "lead_full_name": "${lead_record.first_name || ''} ${lead_record.last_name || ''}",
      "lead_email": "${lead_record.primary_email || ''}",
      "lead_phone": "${extracted_phone}",
      "property_address": "${lead_record.property_address || 'your property'}",
      "property_city": "${lead_record.property_city || 'the area'}",
      "property_state": "${lead_record.property_state || ''}",
      "property_zipcode": "${lead_record.property_zip || ''}",
      "property_value": "${lead_record.property_value || '0'}",
      "property_value_formatted": "${(lead_record.property_value || 0) >= 1000000 ? ((lead_record.property_value / 1000000).toFixed(1) + 'M') : (Math.round((lead_record.property_value || 0) / 1000) + 'K')}",
      "estimated_equity": "${lead_record.estimated_equity || '0'}",
      "estimated_equity_formatted": "${(lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) >= 1000000 ? ((lead_record.estimated_equity / 1000000).toFixed(1) + 'M') : (Math.round((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) / 1000) + 'K')}",
      "equity_50_percent": "${Math.floor((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) * 0.5)}",
      "equity_50_formatted": "${((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) * 0.5) >= 1000000 ? (((lead_record.estimated_equity * 0.5) / 1000000).toFixed(1) + 'M') : (Math.round((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) * 0.5 / 1000) + 'K')}",
      "equity_60_percent": "${Math.floor((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) * 0.6)}",
      "equity_60_formatted": "${((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) * 0.6) >= 1000000 ? (((lead_record.estimated_equity * 0.6) / 1000000).toFixed(1) + 'M') : (Math.round((lead_record.estimated_equity || 0) * 0.6 / 1000) + 'K')}",
      "campaign_archetype": "${lead_record.campaign_archetype || 'direct'}",
      "persona_assignment": "${lead_record.assigned_persona || 'general'}",
      "broker_company": "${lead_record.broker_company || 'our partner company'}",
      "broker_full_name": "${lead_record.broker_contact_name || 'your specialist'}",
      "broker_nmls": "${lead_record.broker_nmls || 'licensed'}",
      "broker_phone": "${lead_record.broker_phone || ''}",
      "broker_display": "${lead_record.broker_contact_name || 'your specialist'}, NMLS ${lead_record.broker_nmls || 'licensed'}",
      "persona_sender_name": "{{ $json.persona_sender_name }}",
      "call_context": "outbound"
    }
  }
}
```

**NOTE:** We are NOT passing broker_first_name or persona_first_name to avoid schema errors. Barbara will extract first names from the full name variables herself.

**CRITICAL: VAPI MCP Server uses "phoneNumber" NOT "number" in customer object**

**COMPLIANCE NOTE:** Barbara will introduce herself as "Hi, this is Barbara, the scheduling assistant with {{broker_company}}" using the dynamic broker variable (compliant positioning per TCPA + AI disclosure guidelines).

NOTE: If VAPI call fails, log the error but continue to next step (don't stop workflow)

**3D. Log inbound interaction:**
Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
INSERT INTO interactions (lead_id, type, direction, content, metadata, created_at) 
SELECT 
  '${lead_record.id}',
  'email_replied',
  'inbound',
  'Reply: phone provided',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'intent', 'phone_provided',
    'phone', '${extracted_phone}',
    'campaign_id', '{{ $json.campaign_id }}',
    'reply_text', $escape${{ $json.reply_text }}$escape$,
    'email_id', '{{ $json.reply_to_uuid }}'
  ),
  NOW()
RETURNING id
```

**3E. DO NOT send email reply** - Barbara will call them instead

---

### IF UNSUBSCRIBE:

**3A. Update lead status:**
Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
UPDATE leads SET status = 'do_not_contact', campaign_status = 'unsubscribed', last_reply_at = NOW() WHERE primary_email = '{{ $json.lead_email }}' RETURNING id
```

**3B. Log interaction:**
Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
INSERT INTO interactions (lead_id, type, direction, content, metadata, created_at) 
SELECT 
  '${lead_record.id}',
  'email_replied',
  'inbound',
  'Unsubscribe request',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'intent', 'unsubscribe',
    'campaign_id', '{{ $json.campaign_id }}',
    'reply_text', $escape${{ $json.reply_text }}$escape$
  ),
  NOW()
RETURNING id
```

**3C. DO NOT send email** - Honor request immediately

---

### IF QUESTION:

**3A. Identify ALL questions in the reply:**
First, carefully parse {{ $json.reply_text }} to identify EVERY distinct question the lead is asking.
- Count the total number of questions
- List each question separately
- Note: Leads often ask 2-4 questions in one email - YOU MUST ANSWER ALL OF THEM

Example: If they ask "what happens if i go to hospice?" AND "when i die who sales the house?" - that's TWO questions requiring TWO separate answers.

Store as: questions_list (mental note of all questions)

**3B. Determine question topics:**
For EACH question identified, analyze keywords to determine the topic:
- costs/fees/expensive → topic: "costs and fees"
- qualify/eligible/age → topic: "eligibility requirements"
- how does/how long/process/work/mechanics → topic: "process and mechanics"
- equity/money/amount → topic: "equity calculation"
- die/death/heirs/estate/sell/family → topic: "repayment and settlement"
- hospice/nursing home/move/leave → topic: "leaving the home"

Store as: question_topics (list of topics for each question)

**3C. Search Knowledge Base (MULTI-TOPIC):**
Call the tool named **_Knowledge_Base** (this is the Vector Store with reverse mortgage information).

**CRITICAL FOR MULTIPLE QUESTIONS:** Use a COMBINED search query that covers ALL topics:
- If topics include "repayment and settlement" AND "leaving the home" → Call _Knowledge_Base with input: "repayment settlement heirs death family sell hospice nursing home permanently move"
- If topics include "process and mechanics" AND "repayment" → Call _Knowledge_Base with input: "how reverse mortgage works process repayment settlement heirs"
- If only one topic, use the standard single query:
  - "costs and fees" → "costs fees origination mortgage insurance"
  - "eligibility requirements" → "eligibility age 62 requirements"
  - "process and mechanics" → "how reverse mortgage works process"
  - "equity calculation" → "equity calculation principal limit"
  - "repayment and settlement" → "repayment settlement heirs sell estate death"
  - "leaving the home" → "nursing home hospice permanently move obligations"

**IMPORTANT:** The combined search will return KB chunks covering multiple topics. Use these to answer ALL questions.

The KB will return 3-5 chunks. Store as: kb_results

**3D. Compose email response:**

Using the KB results from ${kb_results}, compose an email response that answers **ALL questions** the lead asked.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

**HTML STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):**
- Use <p> tags for paragraphs
- Use <br> tags for line breaks within paragraphs
- **CRITICAL: Add blank <p></p> tags between major sections** for visual paragraph spacing
- **CRITICAL: Use <ul><li> tags for listing costs/fees** - DO NOT list them as plain text
- Use <strong> for emphasis
- NO plain text formatting

**MULTI-QUESTION HANDLING (CRITICAL):**
- **YOU MUST answer EVERY question the lead asked** - not just the easiest one
- If lead asked multiple questions, create separate paragraphs for each answer
- Put blank <p></p> tags between each answer section for visual spacing
- Use <strong> tags to label each answer clearly

**Example structure for 2 questions:**
```html
<p>Hi Testy,</p>

<p>Great questions! Let me address each one:</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Regarding hospice or nursing home care:</strong> [Answer using KB data about moving to nursing facilities, obligations, etc.]</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Regarding what happens when you pass away:</strong> [Answer using KB data about heirs, estate, repayment, etc.]</p>

<p></p>

<p>Barbara, our scheduling assistant, can give you a quick call to answer any other questions and help connect you with a licensed specialist.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What's the best phone number to reach you?</p>

<p></p>

<p>Best,<br>${lead_record.persona_sender_name || 'Equity Connect Team'}</p>
```

**CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Address ${lead_record.first_name} by name
- **Answer EVERY question they asked** using SPECIFIC information from KB results
- For repayment/heirs questions: "Your heirs/family can sell the property to repay the loan and keep any remaining equity"
- For hospice/nursing home questions: "You need to maintain the home as your primary residence. If you move to a nursing facility permanently (typically 12+ months), the loan becomes due"
- **CRITICAL: Format costs as HTML bullet points:** <ul><li><strong>Cost name:</strong> description</li></ul>
- Use compliance language: "approximately", "estimated", "typically"
- Keep under 200 words total (extended limit for multiple questions)

**STICKER SHOCK PREVENTION:**
- Context costs: "Like any mortgage, there are closing costs that can be financed"
- Emphasize benefit: "Most costs are financed into the loan"
- NO specific percentages (not even 2%)
- NO dollar amounts
- Redirect to conversation: "Barbara can explain how the numbers work for your specific situation"

**BARBARA DISCLOSURE:**
- Mention Barbara ONCE only (after answering all questions)
- Always include her role: "Barbara, our scheduling assistant"
- Explain purpose: "can give you a quick call to answer any other questions and help connect you with a licensed specialist"

**TONE & STYLE:**
- Polite but direct
- No fluff or filler words
- Simple, clear language
- Professional and empathetic (especially for death/hospice questions)

**CLOSING:**
- Use blank <p></p> tag before phone request
- Ask: "What's the best phone number to reach you?"
- Use blank <p></p> tag before signature
- Sign: "Best,<br>${lead_record.persona_sender_name || 'Equity Connect Team'}"

Store the composed email as: email_body

**3E. Send email via Instantly MCP:**
The Instantly MCP tool is already connected.
Call reply_to_email with this exact JSON structure:
```json
{
  "reply_to_uuid": "{{ $json.reply_to_uuid }}",
  "eaccount": "{{ $json.sender_account }}",
  "subject": "Re: Your Home Equity",
  "body": {
    "html": "${email_body}"
  }
}
```

**3F. Log inbound interaction:**
Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
INSERT INTO interactions (lead_id, type, direction, content, metadata, created_at) 
VALUES (
  '${lead_record.id}',
  'email_replied',
  'inbound',
  'Reply: multiple questions asked',
  '{}'::jsonb,
  NOW()
)
RETURNING id
```

**3G. Update lead status:**
Call Supabase execute_sql:
```
UPDATE leads SET status = 'replied', last_reply_at = NOW() WHERE primary_email = '{{ $json.lead_email }}' RETURNING id
```

NOTE: Simplified logging to avoid MCP JSON parsing issues. Full reply text is available in Instantly's system.

---

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:**
Before proceeding to STEP 4, verify you have completed ALL required steps for the intent:
- PHONE_PROVIDED: 5 steps (extract, update DB, VAPI call, log inbound, NO email)
- UNSUBSCRIBE: 3 steps (update DB, log interaction, NO email)
- QUESTION: 7 steps (identify questions, determine topics, KB search, compose email, send email, log inbound, update DB)
- INTEREST: 4 steps (compose email, send email, log inbound, update DB)

If you have NOT completed all steps, GO BACK and complete them now.

---

## STEP 4: Output Summary

After completing ALL steps for the intent, return ONLY this simple text:

"Reply processed successfully. Intent: [PHONE_PROVIDED/QUESTION/INTEREST/UNSUBSCRIBE]"

DO NOT include any other details, variables, or complex formatting. Keep it simple.

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**Using $escape$ for text fields:**
The $escape$ delimiter in PostgreSQL allows multi-line text without quote escaping.
This prevents SQL injection and handles apostrophes automatically.

**JSONB metadata benefits:**
- Stores full reply text safely
- Easy to query: metadata->>'phone'
- Flexible for future fields
- AI can read conversation history

**When VAPI is configured:**
Barbara will query interactions table before calling:
```sql
SELECT content, metadata FROM interactions 
WHERE lead_id = '...' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5
```
She'll see: email conversation, phone number, intent, context

---
