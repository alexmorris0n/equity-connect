# SignalWire Phone Pool & Billing Protection **System**

**Complete guide to phone number management and broker fraud prevention**

---

## Overview

This system serves two purposes:

### **1. Phone Number Pool Management**
- Maintain pool of SignalWire numbers by broker company
- Rotate numbers efficiently across leads
- Scale to 100+ brokers with 1,500+ numbers

### **2. Broker Billing Protection**
- Prevent fraud: "Lead didn't show up"
- Track all broker↔lead calls with duration
- Verify appointments with irrefutable call logs
- Enable fair, proof-based billing

---

## The Business Model & Fraud Risk

### **How Equity Connect Gets Paid**

```
EC generates lead → Barbara qualifies → Books appointment → Broker closes
                                                              ↓
                                          EC charges broker $50 per booked appointment
```

### **The Fraud Problem (Without Protection)**

**Broker could cheat:**
```
1. Barbara books appointment with lead Testy
2. EC gives Testy's phone (650-530-0051) to broker
3. Broker calls Testy directly → 15-minute consultation
4. Broker claims: "Lead didn't show up, don't charge me"
5. EC has NO PROOF appointment happened
6. EC loses $50
```

### **The Solution (With Tracking Numbers)**

**EC controls the number:**
```
1. Barbara books appointment
2. Barbara assigns tracking number +1-424-485-1544
3. EC tells broker: "Call +1-424-485-1544 for the appointment"
4. Broker calls +1-424-485-1544 → Routes to Testy's real number
5. EC logs: 15-minute call, broker_to_lead, completed
6. EC has PROOF appointment happened
7. Broker MUST pay (can't dispute call records)
```

✅ **EC wins:** Irrefutable billing proof  
✅ **Broker wins:** Fair billing based on actual contact  
✅ **Lead wins:** Privacy protected (broker never gets real number)  

---

## How the System Works

### **Phase 1: Initial Contact (No Assignment)**

```
Lead replies: "call me at 650-530-0051"
  ↓
n8n extracts phone → Barbara MCP creates call
  ↓
Bridge selects ANY available number from broker's pool
  ↓
Barbara calls from +1-424-485-1544
  ↓
Qualifies lead, answers questions
  ↓
IF NO BOOKING → Number returns to pool immediately
```

**Key:** No tracking needed for qualifying calls.

### **Phase 2: Appointment Booked (Assignment Begins)**

```
Barbara: "You're all set for Tuesday at 10 AM!"
  ↓
Barbara calls book_appointment tool
  ↓
Barbara calls assign_tracking_number tool:
{
  lead_id: "abc-123",
  broker_id: "broker-456",
  signalwire_number: "+14244851544",
  appointment_datetime: "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z"
}
  ↓
Database assigns number:
  - Lead: Testy McTesterson
  - Broker: Walter Richards
  - Release: Oct 23 midnight (day after appointment)
  ↓
Number now "held" for tracking broker↔lead calls
```

**Key:** Assignment ONLY happens when appointment exists.

### **Phase 3: Broker Calls Lead (Billing Verification)**

```
Tuesday 10:00 AM - Broker dials +1-424-485-1544
  ↓
SignalWire receives call, checks: Is this assigned?
  ↓
YES! Assigned to Testy/Walter
  ↓
Caller = Walter's phone → Route to Testy's real phone
  ↓
15-minute call
  ↓
StatusCallback logs to billing_call_logs:
{
  direction: "broker_to_lead",
  duration_seconds: 900,
  status: "completed",
  tracking_number: "+14244851544"
}
  ↓
Appointment VERIFIED ✅ (call > 5 min = billable)
```

**Key:** Every call logged with duration = billing proof.

### **Phase 4: Lead Calls Back (Also Tracked)**

```
Lead calls +1-424-485-1544
  ↓
Bridge: Is this assigned? YES
  ↓
Caller = Testy's phone → Route to Walter's office
  ↓
8-minute follow-up call
  ↓
Logged: lead_to_broker, 480 seconds
```

**Key:** Track ALL calls, not just broker→lead.

### **Phase 5: Nightly Cleanup**

```
Wednesday midnight - Cron runs
  ↓
release_expired_tracking_numbers() executes
  ↓
Checks: Oct 22 appointment + 1 day = Oct 23
  ↓
NOW() >= Oct 23 00:00? YES
  ↓
Release +1-424-485-1544:
  - assignment_status: 'available'
  - currently_assigned_to: NULL
  ↓
Back in pool for next lead
```

**Key:** Simple nightly cleanup at midnight.

## Database Schema

### **signalwire_phone_numbers (Pool + Assignment)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE signalwire_phone_numbers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  assigned_broker_company VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,  -- Which broker owns this
  
  -- Tracking assignment (ONLY when appointment booked)
  currently_assigned_to UUID REFERENCES leads(id),      -- Lead being tracked
  assigned_broker_id UUID REFERENCES brokers(id),       -- Broker for appointment
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP,                                -- When assigned
  release_at TIMESTAMP,                                 -- Midnight after appointment
  assignment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'available',    -- 'available' | 'assigned_for_tracking'
  appointment_scheduled_at TIMESTAMP,                   -- Appointment datetime
  
  -- Stats & Status
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
  total_calls INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_used_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_broker_pool ON signalwire_phone_numbers(assigned_broker_company, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_tracking_lookup ON signalwire_phone_numbers(number, assignment_status) 
WHERE assignment_status = 'assigned_for_tracking';
```

### **billing_call_logs (Billing Verification)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE billing_call_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  
  -- Participants
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id),
  broker_id UUID REFERENCES brokers(id),
  
  -- Call details
  tracking_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,          -- SignalWire number used
  caller_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,            -- Who called
  direction VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,                -- 'broker_to_lead' | 'lead_to_broker'
  duration_seconds INTEGER,                      -- BILLING PROOF!
  call_sid VARCHAR(100),
  call_status VARCHAR(20),
  
  -- Attribution
  appointment_datetime TIMESTAMP,
  campaign_id VARCHAR(100),
  campaign_archetype VARCHAR(100),
  
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Indexes for billing reports
  INDEX idx_billing_broker (broker_id, created_at DESC),
  INDEX idx_billing_appointment (appointment_datetime),
  INDEX idx_billable_calls (duration_seconds) WHERE duration_seconds > 300
);
```

**Key Difference:**
- `signalwire_phone_numbers` = Pool (which numbers exist + current assignments)
- `billing_call_logs` = Audit trail (every call ever made on tracking numbers)

---

## Barbara's Complete Workflow

### **1. Initial Call (No Assignment)**

Barbara uses ANY available number - no tracking.

### **2. Books Appointment → Assigns Tracking Number**

**Barbara's actions:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Book appointment
book_appointment({
  lead_id: "abc-123",
  broker_id: "broker-456",
  scheduled_for: "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z",
  notes: "Lead interested in debt consolidation"
});

// Step 2: IMMEDIATELY assign tracking number
assign_tracking_number({
  lead_id: "abc-123",
  broker_id: "broker-456",
  signalwire_number: "+14244851544",  // From her context
  appointment_datetime: "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z"
});
```

**How Barbara knows the SignalWire number:**

**Outbound (Barbara calling lead):**
- Bridge injects: `SignalWire Number: +14244851544`
- Barbara sees it in context section

**Inbound (Lead calling Barbara):**
- SignalWire sends "To" parameter
- Bridge injects into prompt

**Result:**
- ✅ Number assigned until Oct 23 midnight
- ✅ All future calls logged for billing
- ✅ Broker can't claim no-show

---

## Database Functions

### **1. assign_tracking_number()**

**Purpose:** Assign number after appointment booked.

```sql
SELECT assign_tracking_number(
  'lead-uuid',
  'broker-uuid',
  '+14244851544',
  '2025-10-22T10:00:00Z'
);
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "number": "+14244851544",
  "release_at": "2025-10-23T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Called by:**
- Barbara (after booking)
- n8n Reply Handler (if Gemini Flash books via email)

### **2. release_expired_tracking_numbers()**

**Purpose:** Nightly cleanup at midnight.

```sql
SELECT release_expired_tracking_numbers();
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "released_count": 5
}
```

**Called by:**
- Nightly cron job (midnight)
- n8n scheduled workflow

### **3. get_tracking_number_assignment()**

**Purpose:** Check if number is assigned (for call routing).

```sql
SELECT get_tracking_number_assignment('+14244851544');
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "assigned": true,
  "lead_phone": "+16505300051",
  "broker_phone": "+13104365998",
  "appointment_datetime": "2025-10-22T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Used by:**
- Bridge (to route calls)
- Analytics

## Billing Reports & Fraud Prevention

### **Monthly Broker Invoice**

```sql
SELECT 
  b.company_name,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bcl.duration_seconds > 300) as billable_appointments,
  COUNT(*) as total_calls,
  SUM(bcl.duration_seconds) / 60.0 as total_minutes,
  COUNT(DISTINCT bcl.lead_id) as unique_leads
FROM billing_call_logs bcl
JOIN brokers b ON bcl.broker_id = b.id
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', bcl.created_at) = DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())
GROUP BY b.company_name
ORDER BY billable_appointments DESC;
```

**Output:**
```
company_name       | billable_appointments | total_calls | total_minutes
-------------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------
My Reverse Options | 12                   | 28          | 420.5
Second Broker LLC  | 8                    | 15          | 180.3
```

**Invoice:** 12 × $50 = $600 for My Reverse Options

### **Dispute Resolution: Detailed Call Log**

**Broker claims:** "Lead didn't show up for Oct 22 appointment"

**EC pulls records:**
```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(bcl.created_at, 'Mon DD HH24:MI') as time,
  bcl.direction,
  bcl.duration_seconds as duration,
  CASE 
    WHEN bcl.duration_seconds > 300 THEN '✅ BILLABLE'
    ELSE '❌ Too short'
  END as status
FROM billing_call_logs bcl
WHERE bcl.lead_id = 'abc-123'
  AND bcl.appointment_datetime::date = '2025-10-22'
ORDER BY bcl.created_at;
```

**Result:**
```
time         | direction      | duration | status
-------------|----------------|----------|-------------
Oct 22 10:05 | broker_to_lead | 900 sec  | ✅ BILLABLE
Oct 22 14:30 | lead_to_broker | 180 sec  | ❌ Too short
Oct 22 16:00 | broker_to_lead | 420 sec  | ✅ BILLABLE
```

**EC Response:** "We logged 3 calls totaling 25 minutes. Appointment happened. Charge confirmed."

**Broker:** *pays up* 💰

### **Campaign Performance**

```sql
-- Which campaigns produce best appointments?
SELECT 
  bcl.campaign_archetype,
  COUNT(DISTINCT bcl.lead_id) as leads,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bcl.duration_seconds > 300) as verified_appointments,
  ROUND(AVG(bcl.duration_seconds) FILTER (WHERE bcl.duration_seconds > 60), 0) as avg_duration
FROM billing_call_logs bcl
WHERE bcl.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY bcl.campaign_archetype
ORDER BY verified_appointments DESC;
```

## Setup & Deployment

### **Step 1: Database Migration**

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents from:
database/migrations/20251020_tracking_number_system.sql
```

**This creates:**
- ✅ `billing_call_logs` table
- ✅ `assign_tracking_number()` function
- ✅ `release_expired_tracking_numbers()` function
- ✅ `get_tracking_number_assignment()` function
- ✅ `v_billing_summary` view
- ✅ Nightly cron job (if pg_cron available)

### **Step 2: Deploy Bridge**

Bridge now has:
- ✅ `assign_tracking_number` tool for Barbara
- ✅ Logs calls to `billing_call_logs` via StatusCallback
- ✅ Injects SignalWire number into prompts

Deploy to Northflank (auto-deploys on git push).

### **Step 3: Configure SignalWire StatusCallback**

**For EACH phone number in the pool:**

1. Go to SignalWire Dashboard → Phone Numbers
2. Click each number
3. Set **Voice URL**: `https://bridge.northflank.app/public/inbound-xml`
4. Set **Status Callback URL**: `https://bridge.northflank.app/api/call-status`
5. Method: POST
6. Save

**This enables billing call logging!**

### **Step 4: Set Up Nightly Cleanup**

**Option A: pg_cron (if available)**

Already set up by migration! Verify:
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'release-tracking-numbers';
```

**Option B: n8n Scheduled Workflow**

1. Create workflow: "Nightly Tracking Number Cleanup"
2. Schedule Trigger: `0 0 * * *` (midnight)
3. Supabase Execute Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT release_expired_tracking_numbers();
   ```
4. Activate

### **Step 5: Test End-to-End**

1. Send test email with phone
2. Barbara calls and books appointment
3. Check assignment:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM signalwire_phone_numbers 
   WHERE assignment_status = 'assigned_for_tracking';
   ```
4. Check logs:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM billing_call_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### **Pool Health**

```sql
-- Numbers available vs assigned per broker
SELECT 
  assigned_broker_company,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_status = 'available') as available,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_status = 'assigned_for_tracking') as tracking,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assignment_status = 'assigned_for_tracking') / COUNT(*),
    1
  ) as utilization_pct
FROM signalwire_phone_numbers
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY assigned_broker_company;
```

**Example:**
```
broker_company     | available | tracking | total | utilization_pct
-------------------|-----------|----------|-------|----------------
My Reverse Options | 12        | 3        | 15    | 20.0%
Second Broker LLC  | 18        | 2        | 20    | 10.0%
```

### **Today's Billing Activity**

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT bcl.lead_id) as appointments_today,
  COUNT(*) as total_calls,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bcl.direction = 'broker_to_lead') as broker_outbound,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bcl.direction = 'lead_to_broker') as lead_callbacks,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bcl.duration_seconds > 300) as verified_appointments,
  SUM(bcl.duration_seconds) / 60.0 as total_minutes
FROM billing_call_logs bcl
WHERE DATE(bcl.created_at) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### **Active Tracking Assignments**

```sql
-- Numbers currently assigned (awaiting appointments)
SELECT 
  spn.number,
  spn.assigned_broker_company,
  l.first_name || ' ' || l.last_name as lead,
  b.contact_name as broker,
  TO_CHAR(spn.appointment_scheduled_at, 'Mon DD HH24:MI') as appointment,
  TO_CHAR(spn.release_at, 'Mon DD HH24:MI') as releases_at
FROM signalwire_phone_numbers spn
JOIN leads l ON spn.currently_assigned_to = l.id
JOIN brokers b ON spn.assigned_broker_id = b.id
WHERE spn.assignment_status = 'assigned_for_tracking'
ORDER BY spn.appointment_scheduled_at;
```

## Why This is Better Than VAPI

### **OLD (VAPI System)**

❌ **Held numbers for ALL calls** - Even if lead didn't book  
❌ **Complex 18-hour release logic** - Needed hourly cleanup  
❌ **Manual pool management in n8n** - 3 SQL queries per call  
❌ **No billing protection** - Relied on VAPI's tracking  
❌ **Assignment in leads table** - Cluttered schema  

### **NEW (Barbara MCP + Tracking)**

✅ **Hold ONLY when appointments booked** - Efficient pool usage  
✅ **Simple nightly cleanup** - One cron job at midnight  
✅ **Automatic pool management** - Bridge handles everything  
✅ **Full billing protection** - Call logs = irrefutable proof  
✅ **Clean separation** - Pool table + billing logs table  
✅ **Better analytics** - Campaign attribution, duration tracking  

---

## Troubleshooting

### **"Barbara doesn't assign tracking number"**

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM interactions 
WHERE type = 'tracking_number_assigned'
  AND lead_id = '<lead_id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

If empty: Barbara didn't call the tool.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Barbara's prompt has `assign_tracking_number` documentation
2. Check bridge logs for tool execution
3. Ensure Barbara can see SignalWire number in context

### **"Calls not showing in billing_call_logs"**

**Check StatusCallback configuration:**
- SignalWire Dashboard → Phone Numbers → Each number
- Status Callback URL: `https://bridge.northflank.app/api/call-status`
- Method: POST

**Check bridge logs:**
```bash
# Should see:
💰 BILLING: Tracked call on assigned number
```

### **"Numbers never release"**

**Check cron:**
```sql
-- View cron jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'release-tracking-numbers';

-- View run history
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details 
WHERE jobid = (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'release-tracking-numbers')
ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Manual release:**
```sql
SELECT release_expired_tracking_numbers();
```

### **"No available numbers for broker"**

**Check pool:**
```sql
SELECT assignment_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM signalwire_phone_numbers 
WHERE assigned_broker_company = 'My Reverse Options'
GROUP BY assignment_status;
```

**Solutions:**
1. Run cleanup: `SELECT release_expired_tracking_numbers();`
2. Check broker company name matches exactly
3. Add more numbers to pool

## Scaling

| Scale | Brokers | Numbers | Appointments/Day | Query Time | Cleanup Time |
|-------|---------|---------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Current** | 1 | 5 | ~5 | <1ms | <10ms |
| **Small** | 10 | 150 | ~50 | <2ms | <50ms |
| **Medium** | 50 | 750 | ~250 | <5ms | <200ms |
| **Large** | 100 | 1,500 | ~500 | <5ms | <500ms |
| **XL** | 500 | 7,500 | ~2,500 | <10ms | <2s |

**Bottlenecks:** None! Simple indexed queries scale linearly.
