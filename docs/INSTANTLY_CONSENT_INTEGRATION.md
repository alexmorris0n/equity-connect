2. **`last_name`** - Lead's last name (for {{lastName}})
3. **`broker_name`** - Broker's name for personalization

Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed your home at {{property_address}} and wanted to reach out about a financial option many homeowners over 62 are using.

Your property has approximately {{estimated_equity}} in available equity.

A reverse mortgage could help you:
‚Ä¢ Eliminate monthly mortgage payments
‚Ä¢ Access tax-free cash (up to {{estimated_equity}})
‚Ä¢ Stay in your home for life
‚Ä¢ Never owe more than your home's value

Would you like a free, no-obligation analysis?

Just reply "YES" and I'll send you a personalized breakdown.

Best regards,
{{broker_name}}

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. Leads Not Importing to Instantly**
- **Check campaign feeder workflow** execution logs
- **Verify Instantly API key** is valid
- **Check campaign ID** is correct
- **Verify leads have email addresses** (enrichment completed)

#### **2. Custom Fields Not Populating**
- **Verify field names** match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- **Check data formatting** in n8n (currency with $, addresses formatted)
- **Test with sample lead** before batch import

#### **3. Low Open Rates (<15%)**
- **Check sender domain** reputation (use email warmup)
- **Verify SPF/DKIM** records configured
- **Test subject lines** with A/B testing
- **Check send timing** (avoid weekends/late nights)

#### **4. High Bounce Rates (>5%)**
- **Verify enrichment quality** (PDL email validation)
- **Check email format** validation in workflow
- **Remove obvious invalid** emails (test@, noreply@, etc.)

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check campaign feeder** execution logs
2. **Verify enriched leads** have all required fields
3. **Test Instantly import** with 1-2 leads manually
4. **Review email template** for broken variables
5. **Monitor Instantly dashboard** for delivery issues

## üéØ Best Practices

### **1. Email Design for Seniors**
- **Large fonts** (16px minimum)
- **Simple language** (avoid jargon)
- **Short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Clear call-to-action** ("Reply YES")
- **Mobile-friendly** (60% of seniors use mobile)

### **2. Sender Reputation**
- **Warm up email accounts** before high volume (start 10/day, increase slowly)
- **Monitor spam reports** (keep below 0.1%)
- **Use proper DNS** records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- **Rotate sending accounts** (don't blast from one account)

### **3. Campaign Pacing**
- **Start small:** 50 emails/day per broker
- **Monitor engagement:** Scale up if open rates >25%
- **Pause if issues:** High bounces or spam reports
- **Test constantly:** A/B test subject lines, CTAs

### **4. Lead Quality**
- **Only send to enriched leads** (verified email addresses)
- **Segment by engagement:** Re-engage opens who didn't reply
- **Remove hard bounces** immediately
- **Honor unsubscribes** globally (across all campaigns)
