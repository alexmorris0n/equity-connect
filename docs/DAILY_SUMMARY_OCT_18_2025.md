## ü§ù Major Business Development

### **Dan Thomas - Second Broker Partnership Secured** ‚úÖ

**Big Win:** Dan Thomas has agreed to join as our second broker in the Bay Area!

**Details:**
- **Location:** Bay Area, California (San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose metro)
- **Role:** Second broker - validates multi-broker scaling
- **Significance:** Proves the system can run multiple brokers simultaneously

**Current Broker Network:**
- **Broker #1:** Walter Richards (California - ACTIVE, 750+ offset, campaigns running)
- **Broker #2:** Dan Thomas (Bay Area - NEW, setup in progress)

**What Adding Dan Validates:**
1. **Multi-broker operation** - Two brokers running simultaneously without conflicts
2. **Territory isolation** - Separate lead pools, no overlap
3. **Phone number routing** - Different SignalWire numbers per territory
4. **Campaign scaling** - Parallel email campaigns with different branding
5. **Economics replication** - Confirm $6,027/month profit works across brokers
6. **Path to 100 brokers** - Proves infrastructure can scale

**Next Steps for Dan:**
- [ ] Create broker profile in Supabase
- [ ] Assign Bay Area ZIP codes (45,000-50,000 properties)
- [ ] Create PropertyRadar dynamic list
- [ ] Set up 3 Instantly campaigns (No More Payments, Cash Unlocked, High Equity)
- [ ] Start with 50 leads/day, scale to 100/day
- [ ] Assign SignalWire phone number for Bay Area territory
- [ ] Monitor first 10-20 calls and appointments

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Territory setup, first leads pulled
- **Weeks 2-4:** Email campaigns running, monitoring replies
- **Month 2:** Full 100 leads/day, Barbara calling qualified leads
- **Month 3:** Validate economics and conversion rates

**Impact:** This partnership moves us from **single-broker** (Walter) to **multi-broker** operation. Proves we can scale beyond one territory and validates our path to 100 brokers.

## üîç Strategic Decision: Instantly vs. Nylas

### **Research Question**
Can we replace Instantly.ai with Nylas API for cold email outreach?

### **Answer: NO - Keep Instantly** ‚úÖ

**Key Findings:**

**What Nylas IS Good For:**
- ‚úÖ User-facing email integrations in SaaS apps
- ‚úÖ Embedding email clients into your product
- ‚úÖ Calendar/scheduling features
- ‚úÖ Email tracking (opens, clicks, thread replies)
- ‚úÖ Bi-directional sync with Gmail/Outlook

**What Nylas CANNOT Do (That Instantly Does):**
- ‚ùå Campaign sequences (Day 0, 3, 7, 14 automatic scheduling)
- ‚ùå Sender account rotation (for deliverability)
- ‚ùå Daily send limits per account
- ‚ùå Built-in A/B testing
- ‚ùå Email warmup management
- ‚ùå Deliverability optimization for cold outreach
- ‚ùå Automatic unsubscribe handling
- ‚ùå Campaign analytics dashboard
- ‚ùå Spam monitoring per account

**What We'd Have to Build Ourselves:**
1. **Campaign sequence engine** (2-3 weeks development)
2. **Sender account management** (1-2 weeks)
3. **Deliverability monitoring** (1-2 weeks)
4. **Campaign analytics** (1 week)
5. **Compliance infrastructure** (1 week)

**Total:** 6-9 weeks of development = $10,000-20,000 in engineering time

**Cost Comparison:**
- **Instantly:** $100-300/month (everything included)
- **Nylas:** $125/month base + 6-9 weeks dev time + ongoing maintenance

**Decision:** Keep Instantly. It's purpose-built for cold email outreach. Nylas is excellent but designed for different use cases.

**Better Use of Engineering Time:**
- ‚úÖ Improve campaign copy and conversion rates
- ‚úÖ Optimize Barbara AI conversations
- ‚úÖ Build broker dashboard
- ‚úÖ Scale to more brokers
