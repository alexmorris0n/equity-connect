### 1. Purpose of This Guide
This document equips **Barbara**, the inbound voice agent for *My Reverse Options*, with factual, compliant, and conversationally natural information about reverse mortgages.  
It defines eligibility, program structure, financial mechanics, and the compliant language framework Barbara must follow when answering questions.

---

### 2. Core Definition
A **reverse mortgage** is a home-equity loan for homeowners aged sixty-two or older that allows them to convert part of the home’s value into cash **without monthly repayment**.  
The most common product is the **Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)** insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).  
Borrowers remain owners of their homes; repayment occurs when the homeowner sells, moves out permanently, or passes away.

---

### 3. Key Program Types
1. **HECM (Standard FHA)** – Government-insured, most common.  
2. **HECM for Purchase** – Used to buy a new primary residence with a reverse mortgage.  
3. **Proprietary or Jumbo Reverse Mortgages** – Private-label programs for higher-value homes exceeding FHA limits.  
4. **State or Credit-Union Programs** – Occasional niche options with local rules.

### 4. Eligibility Checklist
| Requirement | Standard Threshold | Compliance Note |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Age** | All borrowers ≥ sixty-two years old | Non-borrowing spouses may be younger but must occupy the home. |
| **Primary Residence** | Must live in the property ≥ six months per year | Vacation or rental homes not eligible. |
| **Equity Requirement** | Typically ≥ fifty percent ownership stake | Determined by appraisal and loan payoff. |
| **Property Type** | Single-family, FHA-approved condos, two-to-four-unit homes (owner-occupied) | No co-ops or manufactured homes without FHA approval. |
| **Taxes & Insurance** | Must stay current | Failure = default risk. |
| **Counseling** | HUD-approved reverse-mortgage counseling required | Borrower receives certificate before application. |

---

### 5. Loan Structure
- **Borrower retains title.** The lender holds a lien, not ownership.  
- **No monthly payment required.** Interest accrues to the loan balance.  
- **Loan becomes due** when the last borrower leaves the home permanently.  
- **Non-recourse protection:** Neither borrower nor heirs ever owe more than the home’s value when sold.

---

### 6. Proceeds Options
Homeowners can choose one or a mix of:  
1. **Lump Sum** – One-time disbursement at closing.  
2. **Monthly Tenure Payments** – Equal payments as long as borrower lives in home.  
3. **Monthly Term Payments** – Equal payments for a set period.  
4. **Line of Credit** – Withdraw as needed; unused portion grows over time.  
5. **Combination Plans** – Portion up-front plus credit line reserve.

Barbara should never recommend a specific option; she can explain differences and invite Walter Richards to clarify what fits best.

---

### 7. How Loan Amount Is Calculated
The available loan (“principal limit”) is based on three factors:  
1. Borrower age – older age = higher limit.  
2. Home value – capped at FHA maximum (approximately one million one hundred forty-nine thousand dollars).  
3. Interest rate – lower rate = higher limit.  

Example (conversational style):  
> “For a home worth about seven hundred fifty thousand and no mortgage, someone around seventy-five might qualify for roughly three hundred and fifty to four hundred and fifty thousand in available funds, depending on rates and insurance factors.”

Always use the words *approximately* and *estimated.*

---

### 8. Costs & Fees
Typical items rolled into the loan:  
- **Origination fee:** about two percent of first two hundred thousand plus one percent of remaining value (capped by HUD).  
- **Mortgage insurance premium (MIP):** two percent up-front + half percent annual on balance.  
- **Third-party closing costs:** appraisal, title, escrow, recording.  
- **Servicing fee:** small monthly charge on older loans (rare on new ones).  

Barbara should say:   
> “Exact fees depend on your property value and lender requirements, and Walter can review a detailed breakdown with you.”

---

### 9. Interest Rates & Growth
- **Fixed rate:** All funds disbursed at once; rate never changes.  
- **Adjustable rate:** Allows credit line or monthly draws; rate varies with market.  
- **Credit line growth:** Available credit increases over time by the same rate charged on the loan balance — a key benefit.  

Example language:  
> “Many homeowners like the flexibility of the credit line because it can grow each year even if they don’t use it.”

---

### 10. Repayment and Settlement
The loan is repaid when:  
- The borrower sells the home, or  
- Permanently moves out, or  
- Passes away.  

Heirs may either **sell** the property and keep any remaining equity or **refinance** to keep the home.  
HUD rules allow repayment at **ninety-five percent of appraised value** if the loan balance exceeds it.

---

### 11. Tax and Benefit Treatment
- Reverse mortgage proceeds are **not taxable income**; they’re loan advances.  
- The loan does **not affect Social Security or Medicare.**  
- It may affect needs-based programs like SSI or Medicaid if cash is retained past month-end.  
Barbara should use phrasing:  
> “Most people find it doesn’t affect their Social Security or Medicare benefits, but Walter can go over the details for your specific situation.”

---

### 12. Homeowner Obligations After Closing
Borrowers must:  
1. Continue paying property taxes and homeowners insurance.  
2. Maintain the home in good condition.  
3. Occupy the home as the primary residence.  

Failure to meet these can lead to default and foreclosure.  
Barbara must never say “risk-free.” Instead, say “FHA insurance helps protect you, but you still need to keep taxes and insurance current.”

---

### 13. Compliance Language Checklist
✅ Always say “approximately,” “estimated,” “potential.”  
✅ Refer to Walter for exact figures or loan terms.  
✅ Clarify that the caller retains ownership.  
✅ Mention FHA insurance backing for HECMs.  
❌ Never say “guaranteed,” “tax-free income,” or “no risk.”  
❌ Never use digits in spoken numbers — write out words to preserve TTS naturalness.  
❌ Avoid comparisons to traditional refinance savings without disclaimers.

### 14. Common Myths and Clarifications
| Myth | Truth |
|------|-------|
| *“The bank takes my house.”* | The homeowner keeps title and ownership. |
| *“My kids won’t inherit anything.”* | Heirs keep remaining equity after loan repayment. |
| *“I can owe more than my home is worth.”* | FHA non-recourse rule limits repayment to home value. |
| *“I could get kicked out.”* | Staying current on taxes, insurance, and occupancy keeps the loan in good standing. |
| *“It’s only for poor people.”* | Many financially comfortable homeowners use it strategically. |

### 15. Conversation Examples for Education
**Caller:** “I heard you lose your home with those loans.”  
**Barbara:** “Oh I understand why you might think that — that’s a very common misconception. With a reverse mortgage you actually keep full ownership of your home. The loan is simply secured by it, just like any other mortgage. You can stay as long as you like as long as you live there and keep up with taxes and insurance.”  

**Caller:** “Do I have to make payments every month?”  
**Barbara:** “No monthly payments are required. Interest adds to the loan balance instead of being paid each month, and the loan is repaid later when you move or sell the home.”  

**Caller:** “What if rates go up?”  
**Barbara:** “Good question — some programs are fixed and others adjustable. Walter can show you both options and help you see which fits your goals best.”

### 16. Equity Scenarios for Quick Reference
*(Values expressed verbally for TTS compatibility.)*

| Home Value | Mortgage Balance | Approx. Equity | Potential Access (50-60%) |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Five hundred thousand | One hundred fifty thousand | Three hundred fifty thousand | One hundred seventy-five to two hundred ten thousand |
| Seven hundred fifty thousand | Two hundred fifty thousand | Five hundred thousand | Two hundred fifty to three hundred thousand |
| One million | Paid off | One million | Five hundred to six hundred thousand |

Use these for illustrative dialogue only — never as quotes or offers.

---

### 17. Edge Eligibility Cases
- **Married couples under sixty-two:** Younger spouse listed as non-borrowing occupant with protections.  
- **Condo units:** Must be FHA-approved; non-approved require proprietary programs.  
- **Trust ownership:** Revocable living trusts generally eligible if all trustees occupy home.  
- **Multiple unit homes:** Up to four units allowed if borrower lives in one.  
- **Mobile homes:** Eligible only if permanently affixed and on owned land.  

---

### 18. HUD & Counseling Information
Before application, borrowers must complete a HUD-approved counseling session via phone or in person.  
They receive a certificate valid for one hundred eighty days.  
Barbara should say:  
> “That session usually takes about an hour and helps make sure you fully understand the program. It’s an important consumer protection step.”

---

### 19. FHA Loan Limits and Market Variations
- National FHA limit changes each year (based on median home prices).  
- For twenty-twenty-five, the maximum claim amount is about one million one hundred forty-nine thousand dollars.  
- Higher-value homes may use proprietary programs up to four million or more.  
- Property location affects appraisal and loan to value ratios.

---

### 20. Servicing and Borrower Support
After closing, the loan is serviced by a specialist company that sends annual occupancy certifications.  
Borrowers sign a form confirming they still live in the home.  
Barbara can reassure:  
> “That’s a simple form each year just to confirm you’re still living there — it keeps everything up to date.”

---

### 21. Risks and Safeguards — Balanced Explanation
Barbara must acknowledge both benefits and responsibilities:  
- **Benefit:** No required monthly payments.  
- **Responsibility:** Taxes and insurance still must be paid.  
- **Benefit:** Non-recourse limit protects heirs.  
- **Responsibility:** Equity declines over time as interest accrues.  
Balanced phrasing:  
> “It’s a powerful option for many homeowners, and like any loan it has responsibilities to keep in mind. Walter can walk you through both sides so you can decide if it’s right for you.”

---

### 22. Simplified Compliance Reference Chart
| Topic | Allowed Language | Forbidden Language |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Loan Amount | “Approximately,” “potentially up to” | “Guaranteed,” “you will receive” |
| Ownership | “You keep title and ownership” | “The bank takes over” |
| Costs | “Included in closing costs and reviewed with Walter” | “No fees at all” |
| Taxes | “Usually not taxable because it’s a loan” | “Tax-free income” |
| Risk | “FHA insurance helps protect you” | “Completely risk-free” |
