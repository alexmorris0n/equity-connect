# PropertyRadar Pull Workflow - FINAL PRODUCTION VERSION

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… PRODUCTION READY  
**Workflow File:** `workflows/propertyradar-list-pull-worker.json`  
**n8n Workflow ID:** CTJmLVrXOJ4kqRRx

---

## What It Does

Automatically pulls reverse mortgage leads from PropertyRadar daily, with:
- Triple-layer deduplication (saves ~$187/day)
- Dynamic capacity per broker (configurable in database)
- Auto-advancing pagination through 52k+ property list
- Automatic queueing for contact enrichment

---

## Workflow Architecture (17 Nodes)

### Trigger & Setup (Nodes 1-3)
1. **Daily Trigger (6am)** - Cron schedule
2. **Fetch Active Brokers** - Supabase: Get all active brokers with their list_id and offset
3. **Prepare Broker State** - Code: Initialize session, validate list_id exists

### List Pull & Pre-Filter (Nodes 4-7)
4. **Get RadarIDs from List** - HTTP: PropertyRadar `/lists/{id}/items` (Start=offset, Limit=capacity)
5. **Extract RadarIDs** - Code: Parse response, extract array of RadarIDs
6. **Filter New RadarIDs** - HTTP: Supabase RPC `filter_new_radar_ids()` - pre-purchase dedup
7. **Check Filtered Results** - Code: Count duplicates, calculate cost savings

### Capacity Management (Nodes 8-9)
8. **Get Broker Leads Today** - HTTP: Supabase RPC `broker_leads_today()` - count already pulled
9. **Trim to Remaining Capacity** - Code: Ensure we don't exceed daily_lead_capacity

### PropertyRadar Purchase (Nodes 10-13)
10. **Preview Purchase (Purchase=0)** - HTTP: PropertyRadar validate request, show count
11. **Check Preview** - Code: Verify response, log preview cost
12. **Purchase Properties (Purchase=1)** - HTTP: PropertyRadar BUY 250 properties (~$187.50)
13. **Parse & Hash Results** - Code: Transform to leads format, compute addr_hash

### Database Insert & Queue (Nodes 14-15)
14. **Upsert Lead to Supabase** - HTTP: Supabase RPC `upsert_lead_from_radar()` (250Ã—)
15. **Queue for Enrichment** - Supabase Insert: Create 250 `pipeline_events` for enrichment (250Ã—)

### Finalization (Nodes 16-17)
16. **Aggregate Leads** - Code: Combine 250 items â†’ 1 for offset update
17. **Update Broker Offset** - HTTP: Supabase RPC `update_broker_offset()` (runs once!)

## Database Functions Used

### 1. `filter_new_radar_ids(ids text[])`
**Purpose:** Pre-purchase deduplication - returns only RadarIDs not in database  
**Savings:** ~$0.75 per duplicate avoided  
**Returns:** Array of new RadarIDs

### 2. `broker_leads_today(p_broker uuid)`
**Purpose:** Count leads already pulled today for capacity management  
**Returns:** Integer count of today's leads

### 3. `upsert_lead_from_radar(p jsonb)`
**Purpose:** Insert or update lead with triple dedup (radar_id â†’ apn â†’ addr_hash)  
**Returns:** UUID of lead (new or existing)

### 4. `update_broker_offset(p_broker_id uuid, p_increment int)`
**Purpose:** Increment pagination offset for next day's pull  
**Returns:** Broker record with new offset

## Key Features

### âœ… Triple-Layer Deduplication
```
Priority 1: radar_id (PropertyRadar's unique ID)
Priority 2: apn + county_fips (assessor parcel number)
Priority 3: addr_hash (normalized address hash)
```

### âœ… Cost Protection
- Pre-filters duplicates BEFORE purchase (saves $0.75/duplicate)
- Tracks broker daily capacity (prevents overage)
- Preview validates request before real purchase

### âœ… Multi-Broker Support
- n8n automatically processes each broker in parallel
- Each broker has independent list_id, offset, capacity
- Scales to 100+ brokers with no code changes

### âœ… Auto-Advancing Pagination
```
Day 1: Offset=0, Pull IDs 0-249, Update offsetâ†’250
Day 2: Offset=250, Pull IDs 250-499, Update offsetâ†’500
Day 3: Offset=500, Pull IDs 500-749, Update offsetâ†’750
...
Day 211: Offset=52,500, Pull IDs 52,500-52,749, Update offsetâ†’52,750
Day 212: Offset=52,750, Pull last 73 IDs, Done with list
```

### âœ… Enrichment Queue Integration
- After inserting leads, creates `pipeline_events` records
- Separate enrichment workflow processes queue every 5 min
- Modular design: pull workflow is independent of enrichment

---

## Configuration Variables (Per Broker in Database)

| Column | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `daily_lead_capacity` | 250 | How many properties to pull per day |
| `propertyradar_list_id` | Required | PropertyRadar dynamic list ID (e.g., "1104668") |
| `propertyradar_offset` | 0 | Current position in list (auto-increments) |

**To change capacity:**
```sql
UPDATE brokers 
SET daily_lead_capacity = 500 
WHERE id = 'broker-uuid';
```

## Execution Stats (From Production Run)

**Execution 3568:**
- Duration: 41 seconds
- Properties purchased: 250
- Cost: ~$187.50
- Duplicates filtered: 0 (first run)
- Offset updated: 0 â†’ 250 âœ…
- Enrichment events queued: 250 âœ…

**Lead Quality:**
- Property values: $548k - $1.78M (avg: $873k)
- Average equity: $692k
- All owner-occupied: Yes

## Daily Schedule

```
6:00 AM - Workflow triggers automatically
6:00-6:01 - Fetch brokers, get list IDs, check capacity
6:01-6:01:30 - Pull 250 RadarIDs from PropertyRadar list
6:01:30-6:02 - Filter duplicates (Supabase RPC)
6:02-6:02:30 - Purchase 250 properties from PropertyRadar
6:02:30-6:03 - Parse and insert to Supabase (250 leads)
6:03-6:03:30 - Queue 250 enrichment events
6:03:30 - Update broker offset
6:03:30 - Workflow complete

Total: ~3.5 minutes per broker
```

**With 3 brokers:** All run in parallel, still ~3.5 min total

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)

### PropertyRadar Persons Enrichment Workflow
```
1. Every 5 min: Check pipeline_events for pending enrichment
2. Get lead from database
3. Call PropertyRadar /v1/properties/{RadarID}/persons?Purchase=1
4. Extract: first_name, last_name, email, phone
5. Update lead in database
6. If email found â†’ mark complete
7. If no email â†’ queue for PDL enrichment
```

### PDL Fallback Enrichment (Phase 2)
```
1. Process PDL-queued events
2. Call PDL Person API with address + name
3. Get email + phone
4. Update lead
5. Mark complete
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow doesn't pull leads
- Check: Broker has `propertyradar_list_id` populated
- Check: List exists in PropertyRadar (verify via helper workflow)
- Check: Offset hasn't exceeded list size (52,823 for current list)

### Offset jumped by 62,500 instead of 250
- Fixed! Aggregation node prevents this now
- If happens: Check that "Aggregate Leads" runs BEFORE "Update Broker Offset"

### All leads filtered as duplicates
- This is correct if re-running same day
- Clear test data: `DELETE FROM leads WHERE source='propertyradar'`
- Reset offset: `UPDATE brokers SET propertyradar_offset=0`
