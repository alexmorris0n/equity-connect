# Appointment Commitment Psychology

## Why This Matters

**Problem:** No-shows cost money
- 30-50% no-show rate = Lost revenue
- Broker wastes time
- Lead loses opportunity

**Solution:** Build psychological commitment
- Make them verbally commit
- Create accountability
- Get consent for reminders
- Make them feel guilty about missing

## The Commitment Flow

### Step 1: Confirm Time (Get Agreement)
**Barbara says:**
- "Perfect! So just to confirm, you're all set for **Tuesday, October 22nd at 10 AM**. Does that work for you?"

**Psychology:**
- ✅ Repeats full date and time (clarity)
- ✅ Gets explicit confirmation ("yes")
- ✅ First commitment point

**Lead says:** "Yes, that works."

---

### Step 2: Build Accountability (Broker is Waiting)
**Barbara says:**
- "Great! **Walter is looking forward to speaking with you then.**"

**Psychology:**
- ✅ Personalizes the broker (not just "someone")
- ✅ Creates expectation ("looking forward")
- ✅ Implies broker is preparing for THEM specifically

---

### Step 3: Text Reminder Consent (TCPA Compliance + Reminder)
**Barbara says:**
- "Can I send you a quick text reminder the day before so you don't forget?"

**Psychology:**
- ✅ Gets explicit consent (TCPA compliant)
- ✅ Implies they might forget (plants seed)
- ✅ Positions text as helpful (not spam)
- ✅ "Quick" = low commitment

**If yes:**
- "Perfect! You'll get a text on **Monday** to remind you."
  - Specifies exact day (makes it real)

**If no:**
- "No problem! Just make sure to mark it on your calendar."
  - Still plants reminder seed
  - Transfers responsibility to them

---

### Step 4: Final Commitment (Accountability + Guilt Prevention)
**Barbara says:**
- "Now, **[first name]**, **Walter is setting aside this time specifically for you**. Can I count on you to be available when they call?"

**Psychology:**
- ✅ Uses first name (personal)
- ✅ "Setting aside time specifically for you" (exclusive, special)
- ✅ Creates guilt if they miss (someone is waiting)
- ✅ "Can I count on you?" (direct commitment question)
- ✅ Makes them say "yes" again (second verbal commitment)

**Lead says:** "Yes, absolutely."

**Barbara responds:**
- "Wonderful! I really appreciate that. **Walter will have some great options for you.**"

**Psychology:**
- ✅ "I appreciate that" (validates their commitment)
- ✅ Teases value ("great options")
- ✅ Creates anticipation

## Complete Example Conversation

**Barbara:** "Perfect! Let me get that booked for you... Excellent! You're all set for Tuesday at 10 AM."

**Barbara:** "Walter will call you at six five zero, five three zero, zero zero five one. Is that the best number?"

**Lead:** "Yes."

**Barbara:** "I'll send a calendar invite to john.smith@gmail.com. Is that still the best email?"

**Lead:** "Yes."

**Barbara:** "Perfect! So just to confirm, you're all set for **Tuesday, October 22nd at 10 AM**. Does that work for you?"

**Lead:** "Yes, that works."

**Barbara:** "Great! **Walter is looking forward to speaking with you then.** Can I send you a quick text reminder the day before so you don't forget?"

**Lead:** "Sure."

**Barbara:** "Perfect! You'll get a text on Monday to remind you. Now, John, **Walter is setting aside this time specifically for you**. Can I count on you to be available when he calls?"

**Lead:** "Yes, absolutely."

**Barbara:** "Wonderful! I really appreciate that. **Walter will have some great options for you.** Thank you so much, John, and have a wonderful day!"

### 2. Personalization

### 5. Specificity
- ✅ Full date ("Tuesday, October 22nd")
- ✅ Exact time ("10 AM")

- **Result:** Feels real and scheduled, not vague

### 6. TCPA Compliance
