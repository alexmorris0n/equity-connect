# Equity Connect - Master Production Plan

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Current Phase:** Barbara V3 Production - Full Inbound/Outbound Calling + Vue Dashboard Planning
**Latest Updates:** Barbara V3 fully operational with inbound/outbound calls, caller ID detection, lead lookup, appointment booking with email confirmations, Git-based auto-deployment, `shimmer` voice, clean logging. Vue dashboard planned to replace PromptLayer for prompt management.

---

## 🎯 System Overview

Equity Connect is an AI-powered lead generation and nurturing platform for reverse mortgage brokers. The system uses AI agents to autonomously pull qualified property leads, enrich them with contact data, and manage compliant multi-channel outreach campaigns.

**Key Innovation:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture enables one AI agent to orchestrate 4+ external services, replacing 135 deterministic workflow nodes with 13 intelligent nodes.

**Tech Stack:**
- **AI:** Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter (orchestration), OpenAI Realtime (voice)
- **Orchestration:** n8n (self-hosted on Northflank)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Data Sources:** PropertyRadar API (property data + contact enrichment)
- **Outreach:** Instantly.ai (email), OpenAI Realtime + SignalWire (voice)
- **Integration:** MCP servers (Supabase, Instantly, Barbara, SwarmTrace); Direct Supabase client for voice bridge

- [ ] Create PropertyRadar dynamic list for Bay Area (45,000-50,000 properties)
- [ ] Clone Instantly campaigns (3 archetypes with Dan's branding)
- [ ] Set daily_lead_capacity (start with 50/day, scale to 100/day)
- [ ] Assign SignalWire phone number (MyReverseOptions2 for West Coast)
- [ ] Test parallel operation with Walter's existing campaigns

**Expected Timeline:**
- Week 1: Territory setup and first leads pulled
- Week 2-4: Email campaigns active alongside Walter's
- Month 2: Full 100 leads/day, both brokers running simultaneously
- Month 3: Validate multi-broker economics and territory isolation

**Why Dan is Important:**
- Proves we can run multiple brokers without conflicts
- Tests territory-based lead routing
- Validates phone number pool rotation
- Confirms we can scale to 10, then 100 brokers

- **Deployment:** Vercel (auto-deploy on `portal/**` changes)
- **Core Features:**
  - **Prompt Editor** - Edit inbound/outbound prompts with live preview
  - **Voice Selector** - Change voice (alloy/shimmer/echo/coral/sage) without code push
  - **Call Analytics** - View transcripts, success rates, tool usage
  - **Tool Manager** - Enable/disable tools per campaign
  - **Live Call Monitor** - Real-time sentiment, interest, buying signals
- **Database Schema:**
  - `prompt_templates` - Versioned prompts per broker/campaign
  - `prompt_versions` - History/rollback support
  - `prompt_metrics` - Performance tracking per prompt
- **Real-time Config (No Code Push):**
  - Prompts loaded from database per call
  - Voice selection from campaign settings
  - Tool availability toggled via UI
- **Future Features:**
  - A/B testing framework
  - SMS confirmations/reminders (after regulatory approval)
  - Performance analytics per prompt
  - Template variables (`{{lead_name}}`, `{{broker_company}}`)
- **Status:** Planning phase - schema design + feature prioritization
- **Priority:** High - needed for rapid prompt iteration without Git deploys

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Test Barbara V3 inbound calls - caller ID, lead lookup, appointment booking
- [x] Test Barbara V3 outbound calls - correct phone lookup, dynamic prompts
- [x] Voice tuning - switched to `shimmer` for clearer speaking pace
- [x] Clean logging - reduced debug spam
- [ ] Build Vue.js dashboard for prompt management
- [ ] Add SMS confirmation tools (waiting for regulatory approval)
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling & fallbacks
- [ ] A/B test different prompts via database
- [ ] Monitor PromptLayer metrics (until Vue dashboard replaces it)

**9. Cold Email Campaign System** (Sunday/Monday)
- **Multi-Angle Campaign Rotation:** 3 archetypes with automatic retry for non-responders
- **Campaign Config Table:** Database-driven campaign management (`campaigns` table)
- **Campaign History Tracking:** JSONB array tracks all attempts per lead
- **Smart Assignment Logic:** 
  - Round 1: Data-driven (mortgage status, equity level)
  - Round 2-3: Automatic rotation through untried angles
  - Auto-skip after 3 attempts
- **3 Campaign Archetypes:**
  1. "No More Payments" (has mortgage) - eliminate payment angle
  2. "Cash Unlocked" (paid off) - access equity angle  
  3. "High Equity Special" ($500k+) - premium positioning
- **Per-Broker Capacity:** View respects each broker's `daily_lead_capacity`
- **Workflow:** `campaign-feeder-daily-CLEAN.json`
- **Status:** Database ready, workflow built, needs Instantly campaign IDs

**10. Reply Handler + TCPA Consent** (Monday/Tuesday)
- Instantly webhook for reply detection
- Consent form workflow (for phone calls only)
- Database consent recording
- **Status:** Planned

**11. Scaling Strategy (100 Brokers)**
- **Territory Management:**
  - Each broker gets 45,000-50,000 properties
  - ZIP-based territory assignment
  - Automatic PropertyRadar list creation
- **Sustainability Model:**
  - 100 leads/day = 26,400/year per broker (22 work days/month × 12 months)
  - PropertyRadar 60% annual refresh = 27,000-30,000 new properties
  - Auto-refreshing dynamic lists - infinite scalability
- **Infrastructure:**
  - AI workflow scales horizontally (one per broker)
  - Database handles 100 concurrent workflows
  - PropertyRadar + SwarmTrace enrichment (82-84% email, 97% phone, 98-99% cost reduction vs BatchData)
- **Revenue Model:**
  - $6,030 profit per broker per month
  - $603,000 monthly profit at 100 brokers
  - $7.24M annual profit potential

## 📘 Campaign System Quick Reference

### How Campaign Rotation Works

**Round 1 (First Contact):**
- Lead gets data-driven archetype assignment
- High equity ($500k+) → "High Equity Special"
- Debt-free (isFreeAndClear=1) → "Cash Unlocked"
- Has mortgage → "No More Payments"

**Round 2 (14 days later, no reply):**
- Workflow checks `campaign_history`
- Assigns first untried archetype from sequence
- Example: Tried "No More Payments" → Try "Cash Unlocked"

**Round 3 (28 days later, still no reply):**
- Assigns second untried archetype
- Example: Tried both above → Try "High Equity Special"

**Exhausted (42 days, no reply):**
- Lead tried all 3 angles
- Workflow skips lead (returns empty array)
- Can manually reset `campaign_history` to retry

### Managing Campaign IDs

**To add Instantly campaign IDs:**
```sql
UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'your-instantly-uuid-here' 
WHERE archetype = 'no_more_payments';

UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'another-uuid' 
WHERE archetype = 'cash_unlocked';

UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'third-uuid' 
WHERE archetype = 'high_equity_special';
```

**To check campaign history for a lead:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, campaign_history 
FROM leads 
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid';
```

**To reset a lead's campaign history (retry all 3):**
```sql
UPDATE leads 
SET campaign_history = '[]', 
    campaign_archetype = NULL,
    added_to_campaign_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid';
```

**To see campaign distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
  campaign_archetype,
  COUNT(*) as lead_count
FROM leads
WHERE campaign_archetype IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY campaign_archetype;
```
