## üéØ System Overview

Equity Connect is an AI-powered lead generation and nurturing platform for reverse mortgage brokers. The system uses AI agents to autonomously pull qualified property leads, enrich them with contact data, and manage compliant multi-channel outreach campaigns.

**Key Innovation:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture enables one AI agent to orchestrate 4+ external services, replacing 135 deterministic workflow nodes with 13 intelligent nodes.

**Tech Stack:**
- **AI:** Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter (orchestration), OpenAI Realtime (voice)
- **Orchestration:** n8n (self-hosted on Northflank)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Data Sources:** PropertyRadar API (property data + contact enrichment)
- **Outreach:** Instantly.ai (email), OpenAI Realtime + SignalWire (voice)
- **Integration:** MCP servers (Supabase, Instantly, Barbara, SwarmTrace); Direct Supabase client for voice bridge

## üìä Current Production Status

### ü§ù Broker Network

**Broker #1: Walter Richards** - California (ACTIVE)
- **Status:** Live in production
- **Territory:** California (primary focus)
- **Current Offset:** 750+ (PropertyRadar list)
- **Daily Capacity:** 100 leads/day configured
- **Campaigns:** All 3 archetypes active (No More Payments, Cash Unlocked, High Equity)
- **Phone Number:** MyReverseOptions1 (+14244851544)
- **Status:** Actively pulling leads, email campaigns running

**Broker #2: Dan Thomas** - Bay Area, California (NEW)
- **Status:** Agreed to join - setup in progress
- **Territory:** Bay Area (San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose metro areas)
- **Role:** Second broker, validates multi-broker scaling
- **Purpose:** 
  - Prove system works with multiple brokers simultaneously
  - Validate territory isolation and lead routing
  - Test Barbara AI with different broker branding
  - Confirm economics model across multiple territories

**Next Steps for Dan:**
- [ ] Create Dan Thomas broker profile in Supabase
- [ ] Assign Bay Area ZIP codes (separate from Walter's territory)
- [ ] Create PropertyRadar dynamic list for Bay Area (45,000-50,000 properties)
- [ ] Clone Instantly campaigns (3 archetypes with Dan's branding)
- [ ] Set daily_lead_capacity (start with 50/day, scale to 100/day)
- [ ] Assign SignalWire phone number (MyReverseOptions2 for West Coast)
- [ ] Test parallel operation with Walter's existing campaigns

**Expected Timeline:**
- Week 1: Territory setup and first leads pulled
- Week 2-4: Email campaigns active alongside Walter's
- Month 2: Full 100 leads/day, both brokers running simultaneously
- Month 3: Validate multi-broker economics and territory isolation

**Why Dan is Important:**
- Proves we can run multiple brokers without conflicts
- Tests territory-based lead routing
- Validates phone number pool rotation
- Confirms we can scale to 10, then 100 brokers

## üìò Campaign System Quick Reference

### How Campaign Rotation Works

**Round 1 (First Contact):**
- Lead gets data-driven archetype assignment
- High equity ($500k+) ‚Üí "High Equity Special"
- Debt-free (isFreeAndClear=1) ‚Üí "Cash Unlocked"
- Has mortgage ‚Üí "No More Payments"

**Round 2 (14 days later, no reply):**
- Workflow checks `campaign_history`
- Assigns first untried archetype from sequence
- Example: Tried "No More Payments" ‚Üí Try "Cash Unlocked"

**Round 3 (28 days later, still no reply):**
- Assigns second untried archetype
- Example: Tried both above ‚Üí Try "High Equity Special"

**Exhausted (42 days, no reply):**
- Lead tried all 3 angles
- Workflow skips lead (returns empty array)
- Can manually reset `campaign_history` to retry

### Managing Campaign IDs

**To add Instantly campaign IDs:**
```sql
UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'your-instantly-uuid-here' 
WHERE archetype = 'no_more_payments';

UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'another-uuid' 
WHERE archetype = 'cash_unlocked';

UPDATE campaigns 
SET instantly_campaign_id = 'third-uuid' 
WHERE archetype = 'high_equity_special';
```

**To check campaign history for a lead:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, campaign_history 
FROM leads 
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid';
```

**To reset a lead's campaign history (retry all 3):**
```sql
UPDATE leads 
SET campaign_history = '[]', 
    campaign_archetype = NULL,
    added_to_campaign_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid';
```

**To see campaign distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
  campaign_archetype,
  COUNT(*) as lead_count
FROM leads
WHERE campaign_archetype IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY campaign_archetype;
```
