#### **Email #2 (Day 3)**

**Subject Line:**
```
{{RANDOM | Strategic | Smart}} options for {{RANDOM | high-equity | high-net-worth}} homeowners
```

**Email Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

Homeowners with high equity like yours often use this program for:

Estate planning:
Keep your cash savings for your children. Use your home equity for your expenses instead.

Investment planning:
Get cash from your home at a low rate. Invest it where you earn more.

Retirement income:
Turn your home equity into monthly income. Delay taking Social Security to get higher benefits later.

Your situation:
You could receive: {{equity_50_percent}} to {{equity_60_percent}}
This money is not taxable

This is complex planning. You should discuss it with your financial advisor.

## üìã **Getting Campaign IDs**

After creating each campaign:

1. Open the campaign in Instantly
2. Look at the URL in your browser
3. Copy the campaign ID (usually at the end of URL)
4. It looks like: `abc123def456`

**Save these IDs - you'll need them for the database!**

Example:
- Campaign #1 ID: `_____________` (fill in)
- Campaign #2 ID: `_____________` (fill in)
- Campaign #3 ID: `_____________` (fill in)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **Next Step: Add to Database**

Once you have all 3 campaign IDs, run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
INSERT INTO campaigns (archetype, campaign_name, instantly_campaign_id) VALUES
('no_more_payments', 'No More Payments', 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_1_ID_HERE'),
('cash_unlocked', 'Cash Unlocked', 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_2_ID_HERE'),
('high_equity_special', 'High Equity Special', 'YOUR_CAMPAIGN_3_ID_HERE');
```

Replace `YOUR_CAMPAIGN_X_ID_HERE` with the actual IDs from Instantly.

---

## üöÄ **After Setup Complete**

When ready to launch:

1. ‚úÖ Add Zapmail mailboxes to Instantly
2. ‚úÖ Assign mailboxes to each campaign
3. ‚úÖ Add campaign IDs to database (SQL above)
4. ‚úÖ Test n8n workflow with 5-10 test leads
5. ‚úÖ Activate campaigns in Instantly
6. ‚úÖ Run campaign feeder workflow

---

## üìù **Notes**

- **Spintax syntax:** Single braces `{option1|option2}` creates variations for deliverability
- **Merge fields:** Double braces `{{firstName}}` for personalization variables
- **Custom fields:** Make sure all 11 custom fields were created (you did this earlier with CSV)
- **senderFirstName:** This pulls from the mailbox persona automatically (e.g., "Sarah" if email is from sarah@equityconnect.com)
- **No links:** Notice NO LINKS in any emails (reply-first strategy for better deliverability)
- **Clean footer:** Just company name + opt-out (you're not a broker, no NMLS needed)

---

## ‚ùì **Troubleshooting**

**If merge fields don't show up:**
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Custom Fields
- Verify all 11 fields exist
- Re-upload test CSV if needed

**If spintax doesn't work:**
- Make sure you're using correct syntax: `{{RANDOM | option1 | option2 | option3}}`
- Must include `RANDOM` keyword
- Spaces around pipe symbols
- Test by sending yourself a test email

**If merge fields show up as {{firstName}} literally:**
- Make sure custom fields exist in Settings ‚Üí Custom Fields
- Field names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)
- Re-upload test CSV if needed

**If campaigns won't save:**
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Make sure delays are set (0, 3, 7, 14 days)
- Verify timezone is selected

---

**Setup should take 20-30 minutes for all 3 campaigns.**

**Good luck! üöÄ**
