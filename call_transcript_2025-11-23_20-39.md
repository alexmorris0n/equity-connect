## Conversation Flow

### User: "Wanna make sure that the lender won't have a problem with that."
**Assistant:** "Having your grandson live with you usually isn't a problem for a reverse mortgage, as long as you continue to live in the home as your primary residence. The loan requires you to keep the home as your main residence, but other family members can live with you. Does that help? What else comes to mind?"

### User: "Yeah."

### User: "And then so my wife is not gonna be on the mortgage, but we've"
**Assistant:** "If your wife is not on the mortgage, that's generally okay for a reverse mortgage as long as the borrower on the loan meets the age and residency requirements."

### User: "been married a long time."
**Assistant:** "If your wife is not going to be on the mortgage, that's okay as long as you are on it and meet the age requirement. Your marital status doesn't prevent you from getting a reverse mortgage."

### User: "And I wanna make sure if something happens to me, there's a way for her to stay in the home."
**Assistant:** "If your wife is not on the mortgage, she can still stay in the home if she continues to live there as her primary residence and keeps up with property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Your reverse mortgage can be set up to allow her to remain in the home after your passing, but it's important to discuss this with your broker to make sure everything is arranged properly. Does that answer your question? What else would you like to know?"

### User: "What kind of fees are associated with this?"
**Assistant:** "Reverse mortgages typically have some fees like an origination fee, closing costs, mortgage insurance, and servicing fees. These can vary depending on the lender and loan size. Would you like me to help you understand what fees might apply specifically to your situation?"

### User: "No. That's"
**Assistant:** "Just to confirm, is there anything else you'd like to ask about reverse mortgages today?"

### User: "And then"
**Assistant:** "Please go ahead with your next question or concern. I'm here to help."

### User: "my daughter told me, like, be careful because it's a scam."
**Assistant:** "It's understandable to be cautious. Reverse mortgages are a legitimate financial product, but it's important to work with a trusted, licensed broker who can explain everything clearly and answer your questions. If you like, I can connect you with your assigned broker, Walter Richards, to help you feel more comfortable. Would you like that?"

### User: "And"

**[SYSTEM ROUTES TO OBJECTIONS NODE]**

**Assistant:** "I understand that worry about scams. Reverse mortgages are government-insured loans, and your assigned broker, Walter Richards, is licensed and trained to help you safely. This is a well-regulated program designed to help homeowners like you access your home equity without monthly payments. Does that help with your concern?"

### User: "people are losing their homes and end up homeless."
**Assistant:** "I understand that fear about losing your home. With a reverse mortgage, you keep the title and ownership of your home, and you won't have to make monthly loan payments. You must keep up with property taxes, insurance, and maintenance to stay in the home. If those obligations are met, you won't lose your home because of the reverse mortgage. Does that help ease your concern?"

### User: "Is that, that true?"
**Assistant:** "I understand that worry about losing your home. With a reverse mortgage, you keep the title and ownership of your home as long as you meet the loan obligations, like living in the home as your primary residence and keeping up with property taxes and insurance. If those requirements are met, you will not lose your home or become homeless because of the loan. Does that help ease your concern?"

### User: "Is there any way to set up a loan to automatically pay property taxes? Or just have to manually do it?"
