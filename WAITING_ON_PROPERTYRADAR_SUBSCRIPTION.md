### **Contact PropertyRadar:**
**Email:** support@propertyradar.com or sales team

**What to say:**
> "I need the API subscription on **monthly billing** (not annual) to test the integration before committing to a year. My use case is reverse mortgage lead generation pulling ~7,500 properties/month. Can you enable monthly billing or provide a 30-day trial?"

---

## 💰 **Cost Justification for PropertyRadar:**

If they push back on monthly, here's your business case:

### **Your Use Case:**
- 250 qualified leads/day (7,500/month)
- Reverse mortgage broker lead generation
- Migrating from BatchData (saved $185k/month already!)
- Need to validate API integration before annual commitment

### **Your Spend with PropertyRadar:**
```
Monthly subscription: $599
Property exports: 7,500 × $0.012 = $90
Email append: 5,000 × $0.04 = $200 (2,500 free)
Phone append: 5,000 × $0.04 = $200 (2,500 free)
───────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: ~$1,089/month
Annual value: ~$13,000/year
```

**You're a high-value customer! They should accommodate monthly billing.**

## 🔄 **Alternative: Can You Test with ATTOM While Waiting?**

Since everything is built with backward compatibility, you COULD:

### **Option A: Enable ATTOM Temporarily**
- You already have ATTOM API key: `90f712a7f24d63441c9e42386a9f7328`
- The old "ATTOM Property Lookup" node still exists in the workflow
- Could test the enrichment waterfall with ATTOM data
- Cost: ~$0.21/lead (higher but validates the pipeline)

**Want me to help you test with ATTOM while you negotiate with PropertyRadar?**

---

### **Option B: Wait for PropertyRadar**
- Everything is ready to go
- Just need the API token
- Once you have it, literally 2-minute setup
- Then immediate testing

---

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

**Immediate:**
1. Contact PropertyRadar sales/support about monthly billing
2. Request 30-day trial if available
3. Explain high-value use case (~$13k/year)

**Once You Get PropertyRadar Access:**
1. Create Import List (source = API)
2. Get List-specific API token
3. Update n8n Bearer Auth credential
4. Test with `Purchase: 0` (no charges)
5. Verify count and fields
6. Switch to `Purchase: 1` for production
7. Enable cron triggers

---

## 💡 **My Recommendation:**

**Push PropertyRadar for monthly billing!**

Tell them:
- You're migrating a production system
- Need validation period before annual commitment
- You're a $13k/year customer
- If they can't do monthly, ask for 60-day trial instead of 30

**Most SaaS companies will accommodate this for enterprise customers!**

**What do you want to do?**
- Contact PropertyRadar and wait?
- Or test with ATTOM temporarily while you negotiate?

Let me know! 🎯
