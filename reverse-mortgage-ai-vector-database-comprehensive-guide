## 2. REVERSE MORTGAGE FUNDAMENTALS

### 2.1 Basic Definition and Mechanics

**What is a Reverse Mortgage:**
A reverse mortgage is a loan that allows homeowners age 62 and older to convert part of their home equity into cash without monthly mortgage payments. The loan is repaid when the borrower moves, sells the home, or passes away.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Borrower retains ownership of the home
- No monthly mortgage payments required (property taxes, insurance, and maintenance still required)
- Loan balance increases over time due to accruing interest
- Non-recourse loan (borrowers or heirs never owe more than home value)

### 2.2 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Details

**HECM is the most common type:**
- Federally insured by FHA
- HUD-approved counseling required
- Maximum loan amount based on FHA lending limits
- Mortgage insurance premium required
- Financial assessment mandatory

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Age 62 or older (all borrowers on title)
- Own home outright or have low mortgage balance
- Occupy property as primary residence
- Meet financial assessment criteria
- Complete HUD-approved counseling session

### 2.3 Property Requirements

**Eligible Property Types:**
- Single-family homes
- FHA-approved condominiums
- 2-4 unit properties (borrower must occupy one unit)
- Manufactured homes (must meet HUD requirements)

**Property Maintenance Obligations:**
- Property taxes must be current and paid on time
- Homeowners insurance must be maintained
- Property must be kept in good repair
- HOA fees must be paid if applicable

## 3. COMMON OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES

### 3.1 Ownership Concerns

**Objection: "The bank will own my home"**

**Correct Response:**
"That's a common misconception. With a reverse mortgage, you retain full ownership of your home. The lender has a lien, similar to any mortgage, but only for the amount borrowed plus accrued interest. You remain the owner and can sell, refinance, or leave the home to your heirs. The deed stays in your name throughout the loan."

**Additional Context:**
- Homeowner keeps title to property
- Can sell home at any time
- Can leave home to heirs
- Lender's interest is limited to loan balance

### 3.2 Cost Concerns

**Objection: "Reverse mortgages are too expensive"**

**Correct Response:**
"Reverse mortgage costs have decreased significantly in recent years. While there are upfront costs like mortgage insurance and origination fees, many borrowers find the benefits outweigh these costs. The exact costs depend on your specific situation, including your home value and the amount you borrow. I'd recommend speaking with a HUD-approved counselor who can help you compare all your options and associated costs."

**Cost Breakdown to Explain:**
- Origination fee (capped at $6,000)
- Initial mortgage insurance premium (2% of home value)
- Ongoing mortgage insurance (0.5% annually)
- Third-party closing costs (appraisal, title, recording)
- Servicing fees (monthly, if applicable)

### 3.3 Heir Concerns

**Objection: "My heirs will lose the home"**

**Correct Response:**
"Your heirs have several options. They can keep the home by repaying the loan balance, sell the home and keep any remaining equity after paying off the loan, or choose to let the lender handle the sale. The loan is non-recourse, meaning your heirs never owe more than the home's value, even if the loan balance exceeds it."

**Heir Options to Explain:**
- Pay off loan and keep home
- Sell home and keep remaining equity
- Deed home to lender if underwater
- 30 days to decide after borrower's death
- Can get extension if needed for sale

### 3.4 Legitimacy Concerns

**Objection: "Is this a scam?"**

**Correct Response:**
"I understand your concern. Reverse mortgages are legitimate financial products regulated by HUD and the CFPB. All HECM borrowers must complete counseling with a HUD-approved counselor before proceeding. We encourage you to verify our licensing and speak with independent counselors. You can also check our credentials with your state regulatory agency."

**Credibility Indicators:**
- HUD regulation and oversight
- FHA insurance backing
- Required independent counseling
- State licensing requirements
- CFPB complaint database available

### 3.5 Interest Rate Concerns

**Objection: "The interest keeps adding up"**

**Correct Response:**
"Yes, interest does accrue on the outstanding balance since you're not making monthly payments. This means your loan balance increases over time, which reduces your available equity. However, many borrowers find that eliminating monthly mortgage payments provides immediate cash flow relief that outweighs the interest accrual. The specific impact depends on interest rates, how much you borrow, and how long you stay in the home."

**Key Points About Interest:**
- No monthly payments means interest accrues
- Balance grows over time
- Rate can be fixed or adjustable
- Interest is only charged on funds actually received
- Can make payments if desired to control balance growth

Thank you for your interest in learning about reverse mortgages. I'm excited to help you explore whether this financial option could benefit your situation.

Would you like to schedule a time to discuss your specific situation?

## 10. REVERSE MORTGAGE TERMINOLOGY GLOSSARY

### 10.1 Key Terms and Definitions

**Appraisal:**

**Current Interest Rate:**
In the HECM program, the interest rate currently being charged on a loan, which equals the one-year rate for U.S. Treasury Securities, plus a margin.

**Default:**
The failure to meet the loan requirements included in the reverse mortgage. For HECM loans, this includes occupying the home as the principal residence, keeping the home in good repair, and paying the property charges on time.

**Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse:**
A borrower's spouse who is not a co-borrower, but qualifies under HUD's rules to stay in the home after the borrower moves into a healthcare facility for more than 12 consecutive months or passes away.

**Equity:**
The amount the property is currently worth, minus the amount owed on any existing mortgages on the property.

**Federal Housing Administration (FHA):**

## 13. COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO CORRECT

### 13.1 Government Program Misconceptions

**Misconception:** "This is a government program that gives me money"

**Correction:** "While HECM loans are insured by the FHA (a government agency), reverse mortgages are loans made by private lenders. The government insurance protects both you and the lender, but this is not a government benefit program. You are receiving loan proceeds that will need to be repaid when you move, sell, or pass away."

**Misconception:** "The government will pay off my existing mortgage"

**Correction:** "The reverse mortgage loan proceeds can be used to pay off your existing mortgage, but these are loan funds, not government money. You are essentially replacing one loan with another, but eliminating monthly mortgage payments."

### 13.2 Ownership and Control Misconceptions

**Misconception:** "I lose control of my home"

**Correction:** "You maintain complete ownership and control of your home. You can sell it, make improvements, refinance to a conventional loan, or leave it to your heirs. The only restrictions are that you must maintain the property, pay taxes and insurance, and keep it as your primary residence."

**Misconception:** "I can't leave my home to my children"

**Correction:** "You can absolutely leave your home to your children. When you pass away, your heirs have the option to pay off the loan balance and keep the home, sell the home and keep any remaining equity, or let the lender handle the sale if the home is worth less than the loan balance."

### 13.3 Payment and Cost Misconceptions

**Misconception:** "There are no costs with a reverse mortgage"

**Correction:** "Like any mortgage, there are costs associated with a reverse mortgage including origination fees, mortgage insurance, closing costs, and ongoing interest charges. These costs can typically be financed into the loan, but they do reduce the amount of equity available to you."

**Misconception:** "I never have to make any payments"

**Correction:** "While you don't make monthly mortgage payments, you are still responsible for property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA fees, and maintaining the property. Failure to meet these obligations could result in the loan becoming due and potentially foreclosure."
