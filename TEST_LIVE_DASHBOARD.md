# Testing Live Call Dashboard

## Quick Test Guide

### Step 1: Test API Endpoint

```bash
# Test from PowerShell
curl http://localhost:3001/api/active-calls
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "active_count": 0,
  "calls": []
}
```

### Step 2: Simulate Active Call (For Testing)

**Option A: Make real call with Barbara**
- Use n8n or barbara-mcp to create outbound call
- Dashboard will show it while call is active

**Option B: Create test interaction (Manual)**
```sql
-- Insert test "active" interaction
INSERT INTO interactions (
  lead_id,
  broker_id,
  type,
  direction,
  outcome,  -- NULL = still in progress
  content,
  metadata,
  created_at
)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM leads LIMIT 1),  -- Any lead
  (SELECT id FROM brokers LIMIT 1),  -- Any broker
  'ai_call',
  'outbound',
  NULL,  -- NULL outcome = active call
  'Test call in progress',
  '{
    "ai_agent": "barbara",
    "conversation_transcript": [
      {"role": "assistant", "text": "Hi John, this is Barbara - how are you doing today?"},
      {"role": "user", "text": "I'm doing okay, thanks."},
      {"role": "assistant", "text": "Wonderful! What got you interested in learning more about reverse mortgages?"},
      {"role": "user", "text": "My husband needs heart surgery and we need about seventy-five thousand dollars."},
      {"role": "assistant", "text": "I understand. That sounds like an important need. Can I ask you a few questions?"},
      {"role": "user", "text": "Sure, when can we schedule something?"}
    ],
    "money_purpose": "medical",
    "specific_need": "Husband needs surgery - $75k",
    "amount_needed": 75000,
    "timeline": "urgent",
    "objections": [],
    "questions_asked": [],
    "key_details": []
  }'::jsonb,
  NOW()
);
```

**Now check API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/active-calls
```

**You should see:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "active_count": 1,
  "calls": [
    {
      "call_id": "...",
      "lead_name": "John Smith",
      "sentiment": "positive",
      "sentiment_emoji": "😊",
      "interest_level": 80,
      "buying_signals": ["asked to schedule"],
      "latest_signal": "when can we schedule something?"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Add to Portal

**In your portal routing file (e.g., `router/index.js`):**
```javascript
{
  path: '/live-calls',
  name: 'LiveCalls',
  component: () => import('@/components/LiveCallMonitor.vue')
}
```

**Or add to existing dashboard:**
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    
    <!-- Add Live Call Monitor -->
    <LiveCallMonitor />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import LiveCallMonitor from '@/components/LiveCallMonitor.vue';
</script>
```

### Step 4: View Dashboard

Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/live-calls`

**You'll see:**
```

### Step 5: Cleanup Test Data

```sql
-- Delete test interaction
DELETE FROM interactions
WHERE outcome IS NULL
  AND content = 'Test call in progress';
```

## Environment Setup

### Bridge `.env`
```bash
# Already configured
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
```

### Portal `.env`
```bash
# Add this
VITE_BRIDGE_URL=https://bridge.northflank.app

# Or for local testing
VITE_BRIDGE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

---

## Production Deployment

### 1. Deploy Bridge with New Files
```bash
# Bridge will pick up:
# - bridge/api/active-calls.js (new)
# - bridge/server.js (updated with /api/active-calls endpoint)

# Deploy to Northflank (auto-deploys from git)
git add bridge/api/active-calls.js bridge/server.js
git commit -m "Add live call intelligence API"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Add Component to Portal
```bash
# Portal will pick up:
# - portal/src/components/LiveCallMonitor.vue (new)

# Build and deploy portal
cd portal
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting (Vercel/Netlify/etc)
```

## What You Can See

### During Active Calls:

**For Each Call:**
- 👤 Lead name
- 🏢 Broker name
- ⏱️ Duration (live)
- 😊 Sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- 📊 Interest level (0-100%)
- 📍 Current phase (greeting, qualifying, presenting, etc.)
- 🎯 Buying signals (if detected)
- 🚫 Objections (if raised)
- 💬 Talk time ratio
- 📅 Appointment status

**Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds!**

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Monitor Quality
- Barbara talking too much? (talk ratio > 60%)
- Calls taking too long? (duration > 10 minutes)
- Objections trending? (same objection in multiple calls)

### 2. Prioritize Follow-Ups
- High interest + no appointment → Manual follow-up
- Negative sentiment → Human intervention
- Buying signals → Priority callback

### 3. Show Brokers
- "Here are your leads being worked right now"
- Builds trust in AI
- Premium feature for higher-tier brokers

### 4. Demo/Sales
- Show live AI intelligence to prospects
- Impressive visual
- Differentiator from competitors
