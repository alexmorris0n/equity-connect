EMAIL 1 - Curiosity Opener
Subject: {{RANDOM | Quick question about your {{property_city}} home | Saw your property on {{property_address}} | Question about your home equity}}

{{RANDOM | Hi | Hello}} {{firstName}},
I'm {{accountSignature}} with Equity Connect.
I came across your {{property_city}} property and noticed you have {{RANDOM | roughly | approximately | around}} {{estimated_equity}} in equity.
{{RANDOM | Here's something many homeowners in your position don't realize | What a lot of high-equity homeowners don't know}}: you may be able to access a {{RANDOM | significant portion | large part}} of that equity without selling, moving, or taking on monthly payments.
It's called a reverse mortgage - FHA-backed and used by thousands of homeowners as a {{RANDOM | retirement planning tool | financial strategy}}.
{{RANDOM | Is this something you've looked into before? | Have you ever explored this option? | Is this something you've considered?}}

EMAIL 2 - Value Add (Tax/Estate Angle)
Subject: {{RANDOM | Why high-equity homeowners use this | A few things worth knowing | Following up on your {{property_city}} home}}

{{RANDOM | Hi | Hello}} {{firstName}},
{{RANDOM | Wanted to share | Thought I'd mention}} a few reasons homeowners with equity like yours explore this option:
The funds aren't treated as taxable income - unlike withdrawing from retirement accounts or selling investments. {{RANDOM | That can make a real difference | This matters}} come tax time.
Your liquid savings stay intact for your family. You use your home equity for your lifestyle instead. {{RANDOM | And | Plus}} your heirs still inherit any remaining equity after the loan is repaid.
It also gives you flexibility - whether that's monthly income, a lump sum, or a line of credit you can tap when needed.
{{RANDOM | Any questions about how this works? | Anything you'd like me to clarify? | Want me to explain any part of this?}}

Best,
