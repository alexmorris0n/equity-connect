### Use `voice` strings[​](#use-voice-strings "Direct link to use-voice-strings")

Compose the `voice` string using the `<engine id>.<voice id>` syntax.

First, select your engine using the `gcloud`, `polly`, `elevenlabs`, or `deepgram` identifier. Append a period (`.`), and then the specific voice ID (for example, `en-US-Casual-K`) from the TTS provider. Refer to SignalWire's [Supported Voices and Languages](/voice/getting-started/voice-and-languages.md#providers) for guides on configuring voice IDs strings for each provider.

## **Supported voices and languages**[​](#supported-voices-and-languages "Direct link to supported-voices-and-languages")

SignalWire's cloud platform integrates with leading text-to-speech providers. For a comprehensive list of supported engines, languages, and voices, refer to our documentation on [Supported Voices and Languages](/voice/getting-started/voice-and-languages.md).

## **Examples**[​](#examples "Direct link to examples")

### Set a single language[​](#set-a-single-language "Direct link to Set a single language")

SWML will automatically assign the language (and other required parameters) to the defaults in the above table if left unset. This example uses `ai.language` to configure a specific English-speaking voice from ElevenLabs.

* YAML
* JSON

```yaml
languages:
  - name: English
    code: en-US
    voice: elevenlabs.rachel
    speech_fillers:
      - one moment please,
      - hmm...
      - let's see,

```

```yaml
{
  "languages": [
    {
      "name": "English",
      "code": "en-US",
      "voice": "elevenlabs.rachel",
      "speech_fillers": [
        "one moment please,",
        "hmm...",
        "let's see,"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Set multiple languages[​](#set-multiple-languages "Direct link to Set multiple languages")

SWML will automatically assign the language (and other required parameters) to the defaults in the above table if left unset. This example uses `ai.language` to configure multiple languages using different TTS engines.

* YAML
* JSON

```yaml
languages:
  - name: Mandarin
    code: cmn-TW
    voice: gcloud.cmn-TW-Standard-A
  - name: English
    code: en-US
    voice: elevenlabs.rachel

```

```yaml
{
  "languages": [
    {
      "name": "Mandarin",
      "code": "cmn-TW",
      "voice": "gcloud.cmn-TW-Standard-A"
    },
    {
      "name": "English",
      "code": "en-US",
      "voice": "elevenlabs.rachel"
    }
  ]
}

```
