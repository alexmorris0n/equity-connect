[Available neural voices](#neural-voicelist)[Feature and region compatibility](#ntts-regions)

Amazon Polly has a **Neural text-to-speech (NTTS) engine** that can produce even higher quality voices than its standard voices. Standard TTS voices use concatenative synthesis. The standard engine concatenates phonemes of recorded speech, producing very natural-sounding synthesized speech. However, the inevitable variations in speech and the techniques used to segment the waveforms limits the quality of speech. The Amazon Polly NTTS engine doesn't use standard concatenative synthesis to produce speech. It has two parts:

-   A neural network — that converts a sequence of phonemes (the most basic units of language) into a sequence of _spectrograms_. (Spectograms are snapshots of the energy levels in different frequency bands.)
    
-   A vocoder — that converts spectrograms into a nearly continuous audio signal.
    

The first component of the neural TTS system is a sequence-to-sequence model. This model doesn’t create its results solely from the corresponding input but also considers how the sequence of the elements of the input work together. The model chooses the spectrograms that it outputs so that their frequency bands emphasize acoustic features that the human brain uses when processing speech.

The output of this model then passes to a neural vocoder. This converts the spectrograms into speech waveforms. When trained on the large datasets used to build general-purpose concatenative-synthesis systems, this sequence-to-sequence approach will yield higher-quality, more natural-sounding voices.

## Available neural voices

Neural voices are available in 36 languages and language variants. The following table lists the voices.

[Documentation](/index.html)[Amazon Polly](/polly/index.html)[Developer Guide](what-is.html)

[Available generative voices](#generative-voicelist)[Feature and region compatibility](#generative-regions)

Amazon Polly's **generative** text-to-speech (TTS) engine offers the most human-like, emotionally engaged, and adaptive conversational voices available for the use via the Amazon Polly console.

The **Generative engine** is the largest Amazon Polly TTS model to-date. It deploys a billion-parameter transformer that converts raw text into speech codes, followed by a convolution-based decoder that converts these speech codes into waveforms in an incremental, streamable manner. This method shows the widely-reported emergent abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) when trained on increasing volumes of publicly available and proprietary data comprising a variety of voices, languages, and styles.

The Generative engine creates synthetic speech which is emotionally engaged, assertive, and highly colloquial in a way that is remarkably similar to a human voice. You can use these voices as a knowledgeable customer assistant, a virtual trainer, or an advertiser with a near-human synthetic speech.

###### Note

The state-of-the-art technology underlying these voices falls within the paradigm of generative AI for language and voice modelling. A side effect of the technology is that any updates to the training data and the model could result in slight variations to the way the voices sound, even in case when their overall quality improves with model updates. This could have an impact on use cases with different content parts synthesized over a long time period – for example, a season of podcasts.

## Available generative voices

Amazon Polly currently offers 33 voices in a generative variant. These generative voices are also available in a conversational NTTS variant.

###### Note

Generative voices cost is specified on the [Amazon Polly pricing information page](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/).

## Feature and region compatibility

Amazon Polly generative voices are available in the following regions:

-   US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1
    
-   Europe (Frankfurt): eu-central-1
    
-   US West (Oregon): us-west-2
    
-   Other Regions are not available
    

**The following features are supported for generative voices:**

-   Real-time and asynchronous speech synthesis operations.
    
-   Newscaster speaking style is not supported in the **Generative** engine.
    
-   Many (but not all) SSML tags are supported by Amazon Polly. For more information about NTTS-supported SSML tags, see [Supported SSML tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html)
    
-   As with standard voices, you can choose from various sampling rates to optimize the bandwidth and audio quality for your application. Valid sampling rates for standard and neural voices are 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 22 kHz, or 24 kHz. The default for standard voices is 22 kHz. The default for generative voices is 24 kHz. Amazon Polly supports MP3, OGG (Vorbis), and raw PCM audio stream formats.
    

_Support for generating speech marks is currently not available._

###### Note

In the unlikely event of model hallucination, (and with the Generative engine's model behavior of rendering the speech token by token) an imposed emergency stop mechanism is in place. The built-in mechanism stops the model from rendering speech any further. This safety feature is based on data analysis where the model has the potential to hallucinate, usually at the end of the sentence.

There could be cases where the model thinks it is going to hallucinate and then might end up cutting a word during a generation step, thus rendering half the word. This could potentially generate inappropriate results.
