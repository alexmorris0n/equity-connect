## Voice IDs[​](#voice-ids "Direct link to Voice IDs")

Amazon voice IDs are composed of four sections:

| Parameter                | Possible values                                                                                                                               | Description                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `engine`<br />required   | - `amazon`<br />- `polly` (will be deprecated in the future)                                                                                  | TTS engine                              |
| `voice`<br />required    | Choose from the [**Name/ID** column](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html "Available Amazon Polly voices")       | Voice ID                                |
| `model`<br />optional    | `standard`, `neural`, or `generative`                                                                                                         | Amazon Polly model. Default: `standard` |
| `language`<br />optional | Choose from the [**Language code** column](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html "Available Amazon Polly voices") | Sets model language. Default: `en-US`   |

Create the voice string according to the following pattern:

```text
amazon.voice:model:language

```

### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

```bash
# The Danielle voice, which supports the default Standard model and en-US language
amazon.Danielle

# Two equivalent strings for the Standard-model Aditi bilingual voice in the Hindi language
amazon.Aditi:standard:hi-IN
amazon.Aditi:hi-IN

# The Amy Generative model in British English
amazon.Amy:generative:en-GB

```

note

The `polly` engine code is being deprecated. Use `amazon` instead.

Character limits

Amazon Polly has a limit of 3000 chargeable characters in a single request. If your TTS request is longer than 3000 characters, you will experience silence.

---

## Examples[​](#examples-1 "Direct link to Examples")

See how to use Amazon Polly voices on the SignalWire platform.

* SWML
* RELAY Realtime SDK
* Call Flow Builder
* cXML

Use the [**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages.md#use-voice-strings) SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai.md).

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: amazon.Ruth:neural

```

Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play.md#parameters) of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play.md) SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "amazon.Ruth:neural"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model."

```

```javascript
// This example uses the Node.js SDK for SignalWire's RELAY Realtime API.
const playback = await call.playTTS({ 
    text: "Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model.",
    voice: "amazon.Ruth:neural",
});
await playback.ended();

```

# Voices and languages

![A grid of logos for TTS providers on the SignalWire platform.](/assets/images/tts-346a0094d7f5fbfdf8618aaa0004cac8.png)

SignalWire's cloud platform integrates with leading third-party text-to-speech (TTS) providers. This guide describes supported engines, voices, and languages. Refer to each provider's documentation for up-to-date model details and service information.

## **Compare providers and models**[​](#providers "Direct link to providers")

SignalWire's TTS providers offer a wide range of voice engines optimized for various applications. Select a provider, model, and voice according to the following considerations:

**Cost:** When cost-efficiency is the top priority, select a Standard-tier voice from [Google Cloud](/voice/tts/gcloud.md) or [Amazon Polly](/voice/tts/amazon-polly.md). Review our [pricing information](#pricing) to learn more.

**Language support:** Some [Rime](/voice/tts/rime.md) voices are English-Spanish bilingual. [Amazon Polly](/voice/tts/amazon-polly.md), [ElevenLabs](/voice/tts/elevenlabs.md), [Google Cloud](/voice/tts/gcloud.md), and [OpenAI](/voice/tts/openai.md) offer a wide range of supported languages. In addition, all [ElevenLabs](/voice/tts/elevenlabs.md) and [OpenAI](/voice/tts/openai.md) voices are fully multilingual.

**SSML support:** Google Cloud and Amazon Polly support [SSML](/compatibility-api/cxml/voice/say.md#speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml) (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) as a string wrapped in `<speak>` tags. Consult [Google Cloud's SSML docs](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml) for details. Refer to the Amazon Polly docs for more information on [using SSML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/ssml.html) and [supported SSML tags.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supportedtags.html)

## **Use voice identifier strings**[​](#use-voice-identifier-strings "Direct link to use-voice-identifier-strings")

Compose voice identifier strings using the `<engine>.<voice id>` format.

First, select your engine using its identifier (eg., `gcloud`, `amazon`, `elevenlabs`, etc). Append a period (`.`), followed by the specific **voice ID** from the TTS provider.

Case insensitivity

Voice identifier strings are **case insensitive**. For example, `gcloud.en-US-Neural2-A`, `gcloud.en-us-neural2-a`, and `GCLOUD.EN-US-NEURAL2-A` are equivalent.

For detailed instructions for each provider, consult the voice ID references linked in the **Usage** column of the below table.

| TTS provider    | Engine code  | Sample voice ID string                          | Usage                                             |

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `engine`<br />required   | - `amazon`<br />- `polly` (will be deprecated in the future)                                                                                  | TTS engine                              |
| `voice`<br />required    | Choose from the [**Name/ID** column](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html "Available Amazon Polly voices")       | Voice ID                                |
| `model`<br />optional    | `standard`, `neural`, or `generative`                                                                                                         | Amazon Polly model. Default: `standard` |
| `language`<br />optional | Choose from the [**Language code** column](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html "Available Amazon Polly voices") | Sets model language. Default: `en-US`   |

Create the voice string according to the following pattern:

```text
amazon.voice:model:language

```

### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

```bash
# The Danielle voice, which supports the default Standard model and en-US language

```

note

The `polly` engine code is being deprecated. Use `amazon` instead.

Character limits

Amazon Polly has a limit of 3000 chargeable characters in a single request. If your TTS request is longer than 3000 characters, you will experience silence.

---

## Examples[​](#examples-1 "Direct link to Examples")

See how to use Amazon Polly voices on the SignalWire platform.

* SWML
* RELAY Realtime SDK
* Call Flow Builder
* cXML

Use the [**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages.md#use-voice-strings) SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai.md).

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: amazon.Ruth:neural

```

Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play.md#parameters) of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play.md) SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "amazon.Ruth:neural"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model."

```

```javascript
// This example uses the Node.js SDK for SignalWire's RELAY Realtime API.
const playback = await call.playTTS({ 
    text: "Greetings. This is the Ruth voice from Amazon Polly's Neural text-to-speech model.",
    voice: "amazon.Ruth:neural",
});
await playback.ended();

```

# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft's Azure platform offers an impressive array of high-quality, multilingual voices in its Neural model.

## Languages[​](#languages "Direct link to Languages")

Azure Neural voices are interchangeably compatible with all supported languages. Rather than setting language with the language `code`, simply provide input text in the desired language.

Consult the Azure [supported languages resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=tts) for an up-to-date list of supported languages.

Prepend `cartesia.` and the string is ready for use. For example: `cartesia.a167e0f3-df7e-4d52-a9c3-f949145efdab`

---

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

See how to use Cartesia voices on the SignalWire platform.

* SWML
* RELAY Realtime SDK
* Call Flow Builder
* CXML

Use the [**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages.md#use-voice-strings) SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai.md).

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: cartesia.a167e0f3-df7e-4d52-a9c3-f949145efdab

```

Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play.md#parameters) of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play.md) SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "cartesia.a167e0f3-df7e-4d52-a9c3-f949145efdab"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Customer Support Man voice from Cartesia's Sonic text-to-speech model."

```

```javascript
// This example uses the Node.js SDK for SignalWire's RELAY Realtime API.
const playback = await call.playTTS({ 
    text: "Greetings. This is the Customer Support Man voice from Cartesia's Sonic text-to-speech model.",
    voice: "cartesia.a167e0f3-df7e-4d52-a9c3-f949145efdab",
});
await playback.ended();

```

OpenAI voices are not yet supported in Call Flow Builder.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
<Say voice="cartesia.a167e0f3-df7e-4d52-a9c3-f949145efdab">
    Greetings. This is the Customer Support Man voice from Cartesia's Sonic text-to-speech model.
</Say>
</Response>

```

# Deepgram

Deepgram offers a range of **English-speaking** voices for its text-to-speech API, each designed to produce natural-sounding speech output in an array of different accents and speaking styles.

Deepgram's voices are promised to have human-like tones, rhythm, and emotion, lower than 250 ms latency, and are optimized for high-throughput applications.

Consult Deepgram's [TTS models guide](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models) for more information and samples for supported voices.

## Voice IDs[​](#voice-ids "Direct link to Voice IDs")

Copy the voice ID from the **Values** column of Deepgram's [Voice Selection](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tts-models) reference. Prepend `deepgram.` and the string is ready for use. For example: `deepgram.aura-athena-en`

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

Learn how to use Deepgram voices on the SignalWire platform.

* SWML
* RELAY Realtime SDK
* Call Flow Builder
* cXML

Use the [**`languages`**](/swml/methods/ai/languages.md#use-voice-strings) SWML method to set one or more voices for an [AI agent](/swml/methods/ai.md).

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - ai:
      prompt:
        text: Have an open-ended conversation about flowers.
      languages:
        - name: English
          code: en-US
          voice: deepgram.aura-asteria-en

```

Alternatively, use the [**`say_voice`** parameter](/swml/methods/play.md#parameters) of the [**`play`**](/swml/methods/play.md) SWML method to select a voice for basic TTS.

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
  - set:
      say_voice: "deepgram.aura-asteria-en"
  - play: "say:Greetings. This is the Asteria voice from Deepgram's Aura text-to-speech model."

```

```javascript
// This example uses the Node.js SDK for SignalWire's RELAY Realtime API.
const playback = await call.playTTS({ 
    text: "Greetings. This is the Asteria voice from Deepgram's Aura text-to-speech model.",
    voice: "deepgram.aura-asteria-en",
});
await playback.ended();

```

Deepgram voices are not yet supported in Call Flow Builder.

## Languages[​](#languages "Direct link to Languages")

Multilingual v2 voices are designed to be interchangeably compatible with all supported languages. Rather than enforcing language selection with language `code`, this TTS model automatically uses the appropriate language of the input text.

Consult ElevenLabs' [supported languages resource](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/13313366263441-What-languages-do-you-support) for an up-to-date list of supported languages.

## Voice IDs[​](#voice-ids "Direct link to Voice IDs")

Copy the voice ID from the list of supported ElevenLabs voices above. Prepend `elevenlabs.` and the string is ready for use. For example: `elevenlabs.sam`

# Google Cloud

Google Cloud offers a number of robust text-to-speech [voice models](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types). SignalWire supports all Google Cloud voices in both General Availability and Preview [launch stages](https://cloud.google.com/products?hl=en#product-launch-stages), except for the Studio model.

* [Standard](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#standard_voices) is a basic, reliable, and budget-friendly text-to-speech model. The Standard model is less natural-sounding than WaveNet and Neural2, but more cost-effective.
* [WaveNet](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#wavenet_voices) is powered by deep learning technology and offers more natural and lifelike speech output.
* [Neural2](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voice-types#neural2_voices) is based on the same technology used to create [Custom Voices](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/custom-voice/docs) and prioritizes natural and human-like pronunciation and intonation.
* [Polyglot](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/polyglot?hl=en#overview) voices have variants in multiple languages. For example, at time of writing, the `polyglot-1` voice has variants for English (Australia), English (US), French, German, Spanish (Spain), and Spanish (US).

## Languages[​](#languages "Direct link to Languages")

Sample all available voices with [Google's supported voices and languages reference](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices). Copy the voice identifier string in whole from the **Voice name** column.

Unlike the other supported engines, Google Cloud voice identifier strings include both voice and language keys, following the pattern `<language>-<model>-<variant>`. For example:

* English (UK) WaveNet female voice: `en-GB-Wavenet-A`
* Spanish (Spain) Neural2 male voice: `es-ES-Neural2-B`
* Mandarin Chinese Standard female voice: `cmn-CN-Standard-D`

## Voice IDs[​](#voice-ids "Direct link to Voice IDs")

Copy the voice ID in whole from the **Voice name** column of Google's table of [supported voices](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices). Google Cloud voice IDs encode language and model information, so no modification is needed to make these selections. Prepend `gcloud.` and the string is ready for use. For example: `gcloud.en-GB-Wavenet-A`
