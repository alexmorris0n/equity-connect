# ai.hints

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Hints help the AI agent understand certain words or phrases better. Words that can commonly be mispronounced can be added to the hints to help the AI speak more accurately.

| Name            | Type                     | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hints`Optional | `string[]` \| `object[]` | -       | Provide an array of strings and/or objects to guide the AI's pronunciation and understanding of specific words or phrases. See [Hints as strings](#hints-as-strings) and [Hints as objects](#hints-as-objects) for usage details. |

## Hints as strings[​](#hints-as-strings "Direct link to Hints as strings")

When passing an array of `strings`, each string in the `hints` array will be used to give the AI context on how to say certain words. So if a user were to say `Toni` and the hint was `Tony`, the AI would understand that the user said `Tony` and not `Toni`.

## Hints as objects[​](#hints-as-objects "Direct link to Hints as objects")

The `hints` object is an array of objects that contain properties to customize how you want the AI to handle specific words.

### Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

| Name                  | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hint`Required        | `string`  | -       | The hint to match. This will match the string exactly as provided.                                                                 |
| `pattern`Required     | `string`  | -       | A regular expression to match the hint against. This will ensure that the hint has a valid matching pattern before being replaced. |
| `replace`Required     | `string`  | -       | The text to replace the hint with. This will replace the portion of the hint that matches the pattern.                             |
| `ignore_case`Optional | `boolean` | false   | If true, the hint will be matched in a case-insensitive manner. Defaults to false.                                                 |

## Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

The below example showcases using hints as strings and hints as objects. The AI will now understand when someone says `Tony` to always spell it as `Tony`. When someone says `swimmel`, the AI will replace it with `SWML`.

* YAML
* JSON

```yaml
ai:
  hints:
  - Tony
  - hint: swimmel
    pattern: swimmel
    replace: SWML

```

```yaml
{
  "ai": {
    "hints": [
      "Tony",
      {
        "hint": "swimmel",
        "pattern": "swimmel",
        "replace": "SWML"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
