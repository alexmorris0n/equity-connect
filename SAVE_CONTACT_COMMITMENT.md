## How It Works in the Flow

**Barbara says:**
"Now, I want to make sure you have **Walter's direct number** saved in your phone. It's **six five zero, five three zero, zero zero five one**. Go ahead and save that under **Walter from My Reverse Options** so you know it's them calling."

**Then immediately continues (no waiting):**
"Let me tell you what to expect on the call..."

## Why This Works

### 1. Physical Action = Stronger Commitment
- They have to pick up their phone
- Open contacts
- Type in the name and number
- Save it
- **Result:** Much harder to ignore later

### 2. Recognizing the Call
- "So you know it's them calling"
- No more "unknown number" fear
- They'll answer when they see "Walter"

### 3. Shows Importance
- "Direct number" = special access
- "I want to make sure you have..." = caring
- Makes the broker feel more real/personal

### 4. Prevents No-Shows
- They see "Walter from My Reverse Options"
- Not "Unknown" or spam-looking
- Much more likely to answer

## Complete Enhanced Flow (8 Commitments)

**After confirming time:**

**1. Save Contact (Physical Action)**
"Now, I want to make sure you have Walter's direct number saved in your phone. It's six five zero, five three zero, zero zero five one. Go ahead and save that under Walter from My Reverse Options so you know it's them calling."

**2. What to Expect**
"Let me tell you what to expect on the call. Walter is going to walk you through exactly how much cash you could access from your home - we're talking about that six hundred eighty thousand dollars. The call usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes. Sound good?"

**3. Preparation Homework**
"Here's what will make this really valuable for you - before the call, just think about what you'd want to do with that money. Is it travel? Home improvements? Helping family? Walter can tailor the options to what matters most to you."

**4. Barrier Check**
"Is there anything that might come up that could make you miss this call?"

**5. Text Consent**
"Can I send you a quick text reminder the day before so you don't forget?"

**6. Reply YES Request**
"Perfect! You'll get a text on Monday to remind you. Just reply YES to that text to confirm you're all set."

**7. Final Commitment**
"Now, John, Walter is setting aside this time specifically for you and preparing your equity analysis. Can I count on you to be available when he calls?"

**8. Close**
"Wonderful! I really appreciate that. Walter will have some great options for you."
