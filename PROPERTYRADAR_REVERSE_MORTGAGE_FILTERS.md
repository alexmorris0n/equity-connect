## 💰 **COST EFFICIENCY:**

### **Without Pre-Filtering (like ATTOM):**
```
Pull all 50,000 properties: 50,000 × $0.10 = $5,000
Filter client-side to 1,800: Wasted $4,820 on non-qualified
```

### **With PropertyRadar Pre-Filtering:**
```
Pull only 1,800 qualified: 1,800 × $0.012 = $21.60
Phone append (70%): 1,260 × $0.04 = $50.40 (or FREE)
Email append (70%): 1,260 × $0.04 = $50.40 (or FREE)
────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: $122.40 (or $21.60 if within free quota)
```
