# Enrichment Backfill System - Setup Complete âœ“

## Overview
Automated system that monitors enrichment success throughout the day and pulls additional PropertyRadar leads when brokers fall short of their daily capacity targets.

## What Was Built

### âœ… 1. SQL Functions & Infrastructure
**File:** `supabase-backfill-functions.sql`

Created:
- `broker_successful_enrichments_today(p_broker UUID)` - Timezone-aware function (America/Los_Angeles) that counts successfully enriched leads (first_name + last_name + primary_email)
- `vw_broker_daily_attribution` - Dashboard view showing real-time broker attribution, shortfall, and completion percentage
- Performance indexes for fast queries

**Action Required:** Run this SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor

### âœ… 2. Real-Time Backfill Checker
**File:** `workflows/propertyradar-backfill-checker.json`

**Schedule:** Every 2 hours during business hours
**Threshold:** Only triggers if shortfall > 10 leads

**How it works:**
1. Fetches all active brokers
2. For each broker:
   - Queries successful enrichments today (LA timezone)
   - Calculates shortfall: `daily_capacity - enriched_count`
   - If shortfall > 10: Executes pull worker with override parameters
3. Loops through all brokers automatically

**Per-Broker Attribution:** Each broker's shortfall is calculated and pulled independently. If Broker A needs 30 and Broker B needs 15, they each get their exact amount.

### âœ… 3. End-of-Day Safety Check
**File:** `workflows/propertyradar-eod-backfill.json`

**Schedule:** 10pm daily
**Threshold:** None (pulls ANY shortfall, even 1-2 leads)

**Features:**
- Final guarantee all brokers hit their daily target
- Detailed EOD reporting with completion percentages
- Aggregated summary of all broker results

### âœ… 4. Pull Worker Update
**File:** `workflows/propertyradar-list-pull-worker.json`

**Modified:** "Prepare Broker State" node to accept override parameters

**New Parameters:**
- `override_count`: Number of leads to pull (used by backfill)
- `reason`: 'daily', 'backfill_q2h', or 'backfill_eod'

**Backward Compatible:** If no override is passed, works exactly as before using `daily_lead_capacity`

## How It Works End-to-End

### Morning (6am)
1. **Pull Worker** runs for all active brokers
2. Each broker pulls their `daily_lead_capacity` (e.g., 250 leads)
3. Leads queued for enrichment

### Throughout Day (Every 5 mins)
4. **Enrichment Waterfall** processes pending leads
5. Some succeed (get first_name + last_name + email)
6. Some fail (missing required data)

### Throughout Day (Every 2 hours - 8am, 10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 8pm)
7. **Backfill Checker** runs
8. Counts successful enrichments per broker (LA timezone)
9. Example:
   - Broker A: 220 enriched / 250 target = 30 shortfall â†’ pulls 30 more
   - Broker B: 245 enriched / 250 target = 5 shortfall â†’ skips (under threshold)
   - Broker C: 180 enriched / 250 target = 70 shortfall â†’ pulls 70 more

### End of Day (10pm)
10. **EOD Safety Check** runs
11. Final sweep to catch any remaining shortfall
12. Pulls even small amounts (no threshold)
13. Generates daily report

### Next Morning
14. All brokers hit their target enrichments
15. Ready for next day's cycle

## Billing Attribution

**Key Principle:** Brokers are charged for ALL leads pulled, not just successful enrichments.

**Example:**
- Broker daily_capacity: 250
- Morning pull: 250 leads (attributed to broker)
- Successful enrichments: 225 (25 failed)
- Q2H backfill: 25 more leads (attributed to broker)
- **Total broker attribution: 275 pulls**
- **Successful enrichments: 250** âœ“

**How Attribution Works:**
- All leads have `assigned_broker_id` set during upsert
- Billing queries can count ALL leads by broker (regardless of enrichment status)
- Dashboard view shows both total pulls and successful enrichments

## What You Need to Do Manually

### 1. Run SQL Setup
Copy and run `supabase-backfill-functions.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Import Workflows to n8n
- Import `workflows/propertyradar-backfill-checker.json`
- Import `workflows/propertyradar-eod-backfill.json`
- Update existing `workflows/propertyradar-list-pull-worker.json` (already modified)

### 3. Update Enrichment Waterfall (Optional but Recommended)
**File:** `workflows/unified-enrichment-waterfall.json`

**Step 1:** Add column to Supabase:
```sql
ALTER TABLE leads ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS enrichment_quality TEXT;
```

**Step 2:** Add this field to TWO nodes in the workflow:

**Node: "Update Lead (PropertyRadar Data)"** (around line 184)
Add to `fieldsUi.fieldValues` array:
```json
{
  "fieldId": "enrichment_quality",
  "fieldValue": "={{ ($json.first_name && $json.last_name && $json.primary_email) ? 'complete' : 'incomplete' }}"
}
```

**Node: "Update Lead (Merged Best Data)"** (around line 362)
Add the same field:
```json
{
  "fieldId": "enrichment_quality",
  "fieldValue": "={{ ($json.first_name && $json.last_name && $json.primary_email) ? 'complete' : 'incomplete' }}"
}
```

**Note:** This adds quality tracking for future analytics. The backfill system works without it (uses the SQL function that checks first_name + last_name + email directly).

## Testing the System

### Test 1: Manual Q2H Check
1. Run `propertyradar-backfill-checker` workflow manually
2. Check logs for each broker's enrichment counts and shortfalls
3. Verify backfill only triggers for shortfalls > 10

### Test 2: EOD Check
1. Run `propertyradar-eod-backfill` workflow manually
2. Review EOD report showing all brokers
3. Verify it pulls ANY shortfall (no minimum)

### Test 3: Override Parameters
1. Run pull worker manually with test parameters:
   - `broker_id`: test broker UUID
   - `override_count`: 5
   - `reason`: "test"
2. Verify it pulls exactly 5 leads instead of daily_capacity

### Test 4: Attribution Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM vw_broker_daily_attribution;
```
Should show:
- Total pulls today (all leads)
- Successful enrichments (complete only)
- Current shortfall
- Completion percentage

## Monitoring

### Real-Time Dashboard
```sql
SELECT * FROM vw_broker_daily_attribution
ORDER BY current_shortfall DESC;
```

### Check Backfill History
```sql
SELECT 
  b.company_name,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE l.pull_reason = 'backfill_q2h') as q2h_backfills,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE l.pull_reason = 'backfill_eod') as eod_backfills,
  COUNT(*) as total_pulls
FROM leads l
JOIN brokers b ON b.id = l.assigned_broker_id
WHERE l.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY b.company_name;
```

### Check Enrichment Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  b.company_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_leads,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (
    WHERE l.first_name IS NOT NULL 
    AND l.last_name IS NOT NULL 
    AND l.primary_email IS NOT NULL
  ) as enriched,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (
      WHERE l.first_name IS NOT NULL 
      AND l.last_name IS NOT NULL 
      AND l.primary_email IS NOT NULL
    )::NUMERIC / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0) * 100,
    1
  ) as success_rate_pct
FROM leads l
JOIN brokers b ON b.id = l.assigned_broker_id
WHERE l.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY b.company_name;
```

## Expected Results

âœ… **Automatic backfill throughout the day**
- No manual intervention needed
- Adapts to enrichment success rates in real-time

âœ… **Each broker hits daily capacity target**
- By EOD, all brokers have their target number of successfully enriched leads
- Ready for outreach campaigns

âœ… **Timezone-correct counting**
- All "today" calculations respect America/Los_Angeles business day
- No midnight UTC confusion

âœ… **Proper billing attribution**
- Brokers charged for all pulls (successful + failed + backfill)
- Transparent tracking via dashboard view

âœ… **Cost-efficient**
- Only pulls exact shortfall amount
- Q2H threshold (10 leads) prevents wasteful tiny pulls
- EOD sweep ensures no lead left behind

## Troubleshooting

### Backfill not triggering
- Check if shortfall > 10 (for Q2H checker)
- Verify brokers have `status = 'active'`
- Check broker has `propertyradar_list_id` set
- Verify SQL function exists: `SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'broker_successful_enrichments_today'`

### Wrong lead counts
- Verify timezone: Query should use America/Los_Angeles
- Check if `created_at` timestamps are in UTC (default for Supabase)
- Test SQL function directly with a known broker ID

### Execute Workflow not working
- Verify workflow names match exactly: "propertyradar-list-pull-worker"
- Check if pull worker has the updated "Prepare Broker State" code
- Review n8n execution logs for parameter passing

### Attribution incorrect
- Verify all leads have `assigned_broker_id` set
- Check view query: `SELECT * FROM vw_broker_daily_attribution`
- Ensure broker status is 'active'
