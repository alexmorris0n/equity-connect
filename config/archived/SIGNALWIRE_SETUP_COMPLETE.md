## üéØ Your Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Create SWML Script in SignalWire

**What to do:**
1. Log in to SignalWire Dashboard
2. Go to **Resources** ‚Üí **Add** ‚Üí **Script** ‚Üí **SWML Script**
3. Name it: `vapi-barbara-outbound`
4. Copy the YAML content from `config/signalwire-vapi-outbound-script.yaml`
5. **Replace** `+1YourSignalWireNumber` with your actual SignalWire number (e.g., `+15035551234`)
6. Save the script
7. Go to **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí Select your number ‚Üí **Handle Calls Using** ‚Üí Select `vapi-barbara-outbound`
8. Save

**Why:** This routes outbound calls from VAPI through your SignalWire number.

---

### Step 2: Generate SIP Domain & Request Password

**What to do:**
1. In SignalWire Dashboard, go to your `vapi-barbara-outbound` script
2. Click **Addresses & Phone Numbers** section
3. Click **Add** ‚Üí Select **SIP Address**
4. Note your SIP domain (e.g., `equity-connect-vapi.dapp.signalwire.com`)
5. **Contact SignalWire Support** to generate SIP password:
   - Click **Help?** button in dashboard, OR
   - Email: `support@signalwire.com`
   - Subject: "Request SIP Password for VAPI Integration"
   - Body: "I need a SIP password for my domain: [your-domain].dapp.signalwire.com to integrate with VAPI for outbound calling."
6. Save the password when they provide it

**Why:** VAPI needs authentication credentials to route calls through SignalWire.

---

### Step 3: Create VAPI SIP Trunk Credential

**What to do:**
1. Open `config/signalwire-vapi-setup-commands.sh`
2. Find the "STEP 3" section
3. Replace these placeholders:
   - `YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY` - Get from https://dashboard.vapi.ai ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - `YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_SIP_DOMAIN` - From Step 2 (e.g., `equity-connect-vapi.dapp.signalwire.com`)
   - `YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your SignalWire number (e.g., `+15035551234`)
   - `YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_PASSWORD` - From Step 2
4. Run the cURL command in terminal
5. **Save the credential ID** from the response (looks like: `abc123-def456-ghi789`)
6. Paste it into `config/signalwire-phone-numbers.json` ‚Üí `sip_trunk_credential_id` field

**Why:** This creates ONE reusable SIP trunk that all 5 numbers will share.

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "id": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "provider": "byo-sip-trunk",
  "name": "SignalWire Barbara Outbound Trunk",
  ...
}
```

---

### Step 4: Register Your First SignalWire Number

**What to do:**
1. Open `config/signalwire-vapi-setup-commands.sh`
2. Find the "STEP 4" section  
3. Replace these placeholders:
   - `YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY` - Same as Step 3
   - `YOUR_SIGNALWIRE_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your SignalWire number (e.g., `+15035551234`)
   - `YOUR_CREDENTIAL_ID` - The ID you saved in Step 3
4. Run the cURL command in terminal
5. **Save the phone number ID** from the response (looks like: `phone_xyz789`)
6. Paste it into `config/signalwire-phone-numbers.json` ‚Üí `numbers[0].vapi_phone_number_id` field

**Why:** This registers your SignalWire number with VAPI so Barbara can make calls from it.

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "id": "phone_xyz789",
  "number": "+15035551234",
  "provider": "byo-phone-number",
  ...
}
```

### Step 5: Update n8n Workflow

**What to do:**
1. Open n8n at https://your-n8n-instance.com
2. Find workflow: **Instantly Reply Handler - ALL MCP**
3. Open the **ü§ñ AI Agent** node
4. Find the prompt text (very long field)
5. Search for: `**3C1. Get Available Broker Phone Number:**`
6. Replace the entire section from `**3C1...` through `...phoneNumberId": "${selected_phone_number_id}",` with:

```
**3C1. Use SignalWire Phone Number:**
Use this SignalWire phone number ID for all Barbara calls:
phoneNumberId: "PASTE_YOUR_PHONE_ID_HERE"

(Get ID from Step 4 - see config/signalwire-phone-numbers.json)

**3C2. Create Call with ALL 28 VARIABLES (SIGNALWIRE VERSION):**
The VAPI MCP Server is connected. Call create_call with these EXACT parameters:
```json
{
  "assistantId": "cc783b73-004f-406e-a047-9783dfa23efe",
  "phoneNumberId": "PASTE_YOUR_PHONE_ID_HERE",
```

7. Replace both instances of `PASTE_YOUR_PHONE_ID_HERE` with the phone ID from Step 4
8. Save the workflow in n8n

**Why:** This tells the AI Agent to use your SignalWire number for all outbound calls.

**Detailed instructions:** See `config/instantly-reply-handler-signalwire-update.txt`

---

### Step 6: Test the Integration

**What to do:**
1. Send a test email reply with a phone number to trigger the workflow
2. Watch for Barbara to initiate an outbound call
3. Check these dashboards:
   - **VAPI Dashboard** ‚Üí Calls - verify call was initiated
   - **SignalWire Dashboard** ‚Üí Call Logs - verify SIP routing worked
   - **n8n** ‚Üí Executions - verify workflow completed successfully
4. Answer the call and verify:
   - Audio quality is excellent
   - Barbara uses the lead's name (variable passing works)
   - Barbara mentions the correct broker name
   - Conversation flows naturally

**If call doesn't connect:**
- Check SignalWire call logs for error messages
- Verify SWML script is assigned to phone number
- Confirm SIP password is correct
- Check VAPI call logs for authentication errors

---

### Step 7: Purchase Additional 4 Numbers (When Ready)

**What to do (for each new number):**
1. Purchase number in SignalWire Dashboard
2. Assign the same `vapi-barbara-outbound` SWML script (from Step 1)
3. Run the registration cURL command from `config/signalwire-vapi-setup-commands.sh` ‚Üí STEP 5
   - Use the **same** `credentialId` from Step 3
   - Change `number` to the new phone number
   - Change `name` to "SignalWire Barbara #2", "#3", etc.
4. Save the new phone number ID
5. Add to `config/signalwire-phone-numbers.json` ‚Üí `numbers` array
6. (Optional) Update n8n workflow to route by territory/broker

**Why:** All numbers share the same SIP trunk - you don't recreate credentials for each one.

## üìä Cost Savings

**SignalWire vs VAPI Default (Twilio):**

| Item | SignalWire | VAPI Default |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Number rental | ~$1/month | ~$1/month |
| Outbound calls | ~$0.0085/min | ~$0.0140/min |
| Platform fees | None | Varies |

**Savings:** ~40% on per-minute costs

**Example:** 1,000 minutes/month = ~$8.50 (SignalWire) vs ~$14 (Twilio) = **$5.50/month saved per number**

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

- [ ] SignalWire number makes outbound calls through VAPI
- [ ] Barbara uses her correct voice (ElevenLabs "kdmDKE6EkgrWrrykO9Qt")
- [ ] Barbara personalizes conversation with lead's name, city, broker name
- [ ] Barbara presents equity estimates using pre-calculated variables
- [ ] Call audio quality is crystal clear
- [ ] Call logs appear in both VAPI and SignalWire dashboards
- [ ] Costs are tracking at SignalWire rates (~$0.0085/min)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid gateway IP"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the SIP **domain** (e.g., `equity-connect-vapi.dapp.signalwire.com`), not an IP address.

### Problem: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** 
- Verify SignalWire password is correct (contact support to regenerate if needed)
- Confirm `authUsername` is your phone number in E.164 format (+15035551234)

### Problem: "Number already registered"
**Solution:** The number may already exist in VAPI. Run this to check:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

### Problem: Calls not connecting
**Solution:**
1. Check SignalWire: Verify SWML script is assigned to number
2. Check SignalWire: Confirm SIP address exists
3. Check VAPI: Verify credential ID matches in phone number registration
4. Check SignalWire call logs for specific error messages

### Problem: Poor audio quality
**Solution:**
- This is rare with SignalWire (excellent quality)
- Check your internet connection stability
- Verify SignalWire region matches your location
- Contact SignalWire support for latency analysis

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Once all 5 numbers are registered, you can implement:

### Territory-Based Routing
Route California leads to California number, Texas leads to Texas number, etc.

### Broker-Specific Numbers
Each broker gets a dedicated SignalWire number with local area code.

### Load Balancing
Distribute calls across numbers to avoid carrier spam filtering.

### Performance Tracking
Track answer rates, conversation length, and conversion rates per number.

**Implementation:** Add a Code node in n8n before the AI Agent to select phoneNumberId based on lead territory.
